# VPN, eSIM & Payment Setup

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

### Problem
Foreign travelers cannot access global websites (Google, WhatsApp, Instagram) or pay for basic services, creating a "Single Point of Failure" for their trip.

## Part 1: Internet Connectivity (Avoid SPoF)

### Option A: International eSIM (Lowest Friction)
- **Providers:** **Nomad**, **Airalo**, or **3HK**.
- **Pro Tip:** Roaming data natively bypasses the Great Firewall. Gmail and WhatsApp will work without any VPN setup.
- **The Technical Fix:** If your signal stalls or apps won't load, toggle **Airplane Mode -> Reboot**. This forces a fresh registration with the local tower and often resolves routing deadlocks.

### Option B: VPN Deployment (Encrypted Tunnels)
Install these **BEFORE** you land.
1.  **LetsVPN (快连):** (Jan 2026 Choice) The best "hot-patch" right now. Extremely stable for mobile, optimized for the current firewall patterns, and cheap ($5-9/month).
2.  **ExpressVPN:** Reliable again in 2026 using **Lightway protocol + Obfuscation**. Best speeds for high-bandwidth tasks.
3.  **Astrill VPN:** The "heavy-duty" option for laptops. Used by most long-term expats for zero-latency work.

## Part 2: Payments (System Redundancy)

### Alipay & WeChat Pay
- **Setup:** Bind your Visa/Mastercard 2 weeks before flying. 
- **The "Change" Patch:** Carry **500-1000 RMB in cash**. 
  - **Why?** Some local taxis or tiny street stalls might have network issues or "scanning fatigue." 
  - **Pro Tip:** Go to a FamilyMart or 7-Eleven immediately to buy a drink and break your 100 RMB bills into 10s and 20s. Small bills are the ultimate "offline" failover.

## TechDad's Tips (Local Ground Truth)

- **No Tipping:** Tipping is not common. Don't add complexity to the transaction.
- **Low Battery Alert:** You cannot rent a shared power bank if your phone is already dead (you need to scan the QR to release it). **Charge your phone before it hits 15%.**
- **Menu QR Codes:** If a shop requires a WeChat login to order and you don't have it, ask for a **"Physical Menu"** (shítǐ càidān). They almost always have a paper backup.

### Local Hacks / Money-saving Tips
- **App Coupons:** Inside Alipay/WeChat, check the supermarket mini-programs (like **Hema**) for "New User" coupons. You can often save 10-20 RMB on your first grocery run.
- **Offline Translation:** Download the **camera-translation** and **offline language packs** in Google Translate or **Pleco** (essential for dictionary use).
