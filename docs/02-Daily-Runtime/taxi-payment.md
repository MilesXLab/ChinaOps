# Taxi & Mobile Payment

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

### Problem
Tourists struggle to hail taxis or pay cashless in China.

### Root Cause
- Many taxis prefer mobile apps (Didi) over cash.  
- Apps often require local phone numbers.

### Fix / Solution
- Install Didi app with foreign-friendly registration.  
- Carry small cash as backup.

### Miles’ Tips
- Ask hotels for taxi assistance.  
- Check car plate & driver ID before entering.
- **Parent Warning:** Standard taxis and Didi cars **do not provide baby seats**. If you need one, you must bring your own portable seat or book a specific "Premium/Luxury" car via the app and message the driver in advance (though availability is still very limited).

### Recommendations
- Apps: Didi, Meituan Taxi  
- Keep QR codes for app payments ready.

### Local Hacks / Money-saving Tips
- Combine rides (family / group) to split fare.  
- Use airport/hotel shared shuttles for cheaper options.
