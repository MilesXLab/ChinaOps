- **Physical ID:** Passport (Strictly checked at Disney, Towers, and Museums).
- **Booking Window:** Museums require **7-day advance** booking; Disney requires **3-6 months** for holidays.

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The "Cyberpunk" Skyline (Lujiazui)
- **Step 1:** Book **Shanghai Tower** or **Oriental Pearl Tower** on Trip.com 24 hours in advance.
- **Step 2:** Aim for the "Sunset Slot" (varies by season, check weather app).
- **Verification:** Ensure your booking QR code is saved to your "Offline" photos. 2nd floor check-in is the most efficient entrance.

### 2. The Cultural Heritage SOP (Yu Garden)
- **Step 1:** Arrive at **Yu Garden** (Metro Line 10/14) before **9:30 AM**.
- **Step 2:** Use the side entrance near the "City God Temple" to bypass the main tour-bus queue.
- **Verification:** Check the red stamp on your digital ticket at the gate.

### 3. The Disney "Priority" Loop
- **Step 1:** Link your ticket to the **Shanghai Disney Resort App** the night before.
- **Step 2:** Enter the gate at **7:45 AM**. Immediately book your first "Standby Pass" or "Premier Access" for Zootopia or Tron.
- **Verification:** Check the "Live Wait Times" on the map every 30 minutes to pivot your routing.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If an attraction hits "Max Capacity" or is sold out:
1. **The "North Bund" Loophole:** The main Bund is crowded? Walk to the **North Bund (WPP/Raffles)**. It has the same skyline view but 90% fewer tourists.
2. **The "Secondary" Museum:** Shanghai Museum (People's Sq) is full? Go to the **Shanghai Natural History Museum** in Jing'an. It's world-class and often has same-day availability.
3. **Observation Hack:** Towers are full? Go to the **Flaire Rooftop Bar (Ritz-Carlton)** or **The Ritz-Carlton Lobby (52F)**. For the price of a drink, you get a 5-star view without the 2-hour queue.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "10 PM" Blackout:** The Bund lights turn OFF at 22:00. If you arrive at 22:05, you will see a dark river. Plan accordingly.
- **Ferry Strategy:** Use the **2 RMB ferry** between Bund and Lujiazui. Scan your Metro QR. It's the highest ROI view in the city.
- **Child Pricing:** Almost all attractions use **height** as the primary price factor. If your child is < 1.0m, they are usually free. < 1.4m = Half price. Carry a photo of their passport just in case.
- **Water Refill:** Carry a reusable bottle. Shanghai museums and Disneyland have filtered drinking water fountains.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Relying on on-site ticket windows for the Shanghai Tower.
- **Hotfix:** They often stop selling physical tickets 1-2 hours before the observatory closes, even if it's not full. **Always buy digitally.**
