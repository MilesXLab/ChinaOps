# 🚇 Public Transport: Metro, Bikes & Buses

**TL;DR:** Use **Alipay's "Transport"** QR code for everything (Metro, Bus, Ferry). Add a **Shanghai Transit Card** to your Apple/Android wallet for tap-and-go. Avoid Peak Hours (8-9 AM, 5:30-7 PM).

**Prerequisites:**
- **App:** Alipay or WeChat.
- **Verification:** Ensure your "Transport" mini-program is activated (requires one-time ID verification).
- **Physical ID:** Passport (for buying physical cards at some service windows).

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The Metro QR Entry
- **Step 1:** Open **Alipay**. Tap `Transport` (出行) at the top.
- **Step 2:** Choose `Metro` (地铁) and select your city (e.g., Shanghai).
- **Step 3:** Scan the QR code at the turnstile. 
- **Verification:** The gate will open instantly. Payment is deducted after you exit at your destination.

### 2. The Apple Wallet / NFC Hack
- **Step 1:** Open **Apple Wallet**. Tap `+` -> `Transit Card`.
- **Step 2:** Select `Shanghai Public Transport Card`. Add 20-50 RMB.
- **Verification:** You can now tap the back of your phone on any reader in the city without opening an app.

### 3. Shared Bike "Last-Mile" Patch
- **Step 1:** Find a **HelloBike** (Blue - Alipay) or **Meituan Bike** (Yellow).
- **Step 2:** Scan the QR code on the handlebar or lock.
- **Step 3:** Purchase a "7-Day Unlimited" pass if staying for >3 days.
- **Verification:** The lock will pop open.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If your QR code fails or your phone dies:
1. **Physical Ticket Machine:** Go to the ticket kiosks. Note: Most only accept **Alipay/WeChat** or 1 RMB coins and 5/10 RMB notes.
2. **Manned Service Desk:** Look for the **Manned Lane** (Red/Green light service booth). Show them your passport and cash. They can sell you a one-way physical token.
3. **The Bus Backup:** Public buses accept **physical coins (2 RMB)**. If your phone is dead, a bus is often easier to board than the Metro.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "AC" Strategy:** In summer, the front and back cars (1 & 6 or 1 & 8) are often **"Weak Cool"**, while the middle cars are **"Strong Cool"**. Choose according to your tolerance.
- **Stroller Routing:** Look for the **Blue Wheelchair icon** on the platform. It marks the door closest to the station's elevator.
- **Transfer Discount:** In Shanghai, switching from Bus to Metro within 120 mins gives you a **1 RMB discount**.
- **The "Maglev" Loophole:** Show your flight ticket (digital or paper) at the PVG Maglev window to get a discounted 40 RMB ticket.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Relying on the "Transport" QR at 8:30 AM in a deep underground station with **No Signal (LTE/5G)**.
- **Hotfix:** Always open your Transport QR *before* you enter the underground levels, or use the **Apple/Android Wallet (NFC)** which works offline.
