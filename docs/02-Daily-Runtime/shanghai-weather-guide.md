# 🌦️ Shanghai Weather & AQI SOP

**TL;DR:** Shanghai is "Damp Cold" in Winter and "Steamy Hot" in Summer. Use **AirVisual** for AQI monitoring. If a **Typhoon Red Alert** is issued, outdoor city operations (Disney, Bund, Metro Line 3/4) will shut down.

**Prerequisites:**
- **App:** AirVisual (AQI) or China Weather (Caiyun).
- **Physical Gear:** Foldable umbrella (Year-round), N95 masks (Winter), Sunscreen (Spring/Summer).

## 📋 The Monthly Runbook

### 1. Jan - Feb (Winter) | "The Damp Cold Patch"
- **Step 1:** Pack thermal base layers (Uniqlo Heattech is the local standard). 10°C in SH feels like 0°C due to humidity.
- **Step 2:** Check AQI daily. Winter has the highest pollution load.
- **Verification:** Wear a down jacket that is water-resistant; winter rain is common.

### 2. June - July (Plum Rain) | "The Humidity Hack"
- **Step 1:** Carry a high-quality umbrella 100% of the time. Rain is unpredictable and heavy.
- **Step 2:** Use **Amap** to check for "Waterlogging" (flooded streets) if taking a taxi.
- **Verification:** Switch to waterproof shoes or sandals; leather shoes will be ruined in 20 mins of SH rain.

### 3. July - Aug (Peak Heat) | "Environmental Load Management"
- **Step 1:** Stay indoors from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Go to Malls/Museums.
- **Step 2:** Increase hydration by 200%. Carry a refillable bottle.
- **Verification:** Check the "Feel-like" temperature in your app; 35°C often feels like 45°C.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If a Typhoon hits (July - Sept):
1. **The "Shelter-in-Place" SOP:** Most Typhoons last 24-48 hours. Stock up on snacks at a convenience store the night before and stay in your hotel.
2. **Transport Lockdown:** Metro lines that run above ground (Line 3, 4, 5, 11, etc.) will close during high winds. **Action:** Pivot to underground Metro lines (Line 1, 2, 10, 14) which usually remain stable.
3. **AQI Spike (>200):** Avoid all strenuous outdoor activity. Go to the **Shanghai Museum** or **Power Station of Art**; they have high-tier industrial air filtration systems.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "Uniqlo" Node:** If you under-dressed for a cold snap, find a **Uniqlo** (they are in every major mall). Their "Ultra Light Down" and "Heattech" are the most cost-effective patches for Shanghai's weather.
- **Sun Protection:** In Spring (April/May), the sun is deceptive. High UV levels can burn you even if it's only 20°C. 
- **Air Quality Perception:** Don't trust your eyes. "Blue Sky" doesn't always mean low AQI; it could be high Ozone or Fine Particulates (PM2.5). Check the app.
- **The "FamilyMart" Umbrella:** If you're caught in rain, don't buy from street hawkers. Go to **FamilyMart**; their 39 RMB umbrellas are of superior engineering.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Assuming the weather forecast is accurate for more than 48 hours. 
- **Hotfix:** Shanghai is a coastal city; weather systems move fast. Check the "Hourly" forecast on your app every morning before you head out.
