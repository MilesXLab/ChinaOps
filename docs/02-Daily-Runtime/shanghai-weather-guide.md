## 1. Air Quality (AQI) Management
- **Winter Peak:** Smog is most common in Dec-Feb. 
- **The Fix:** Download the **"AirVisual"** or **"AQI"** app. 
- **Hardware Patch:** If AQI > 150, wearing an N95 mask is recommended for those with respiratory sensitivity.

## 2. Typhoon Season (July - September)
- **Impact:** 1-2 major storms usually affect Shanghai per year, bringing heavy rain and high winds. 
- **SOP:** Monitor **"China Weather"** app. If a "Red Warning" is issued, all Metro lines above ground and outdoor attractions (including Disney) will shut down. Stay in your hotel.

## TechDad's Tips

- **The Umbrella Protocol:** Shanghai weather is erratic. A high-quality foldable umbrella is a mandatory piece of hardware for your daily carry.
- **Summer Hydration:** In July/August, the 90%+ humidity makes 32°C feel like 40°C. Carry water and use the free "Hot Water Nodes" in convenience stores (they usually have room-temp water too).
- **Damp Cold:** Shanghai's winter is "wet cold," which feels much colder than dry cold at the same temperature. Layering is more effective than one heavy jacket.

### Local Hacks & Money-Saving Tips
- **AQI Monitoring:** Use **Amap (English version)**; it has a built-in AQI overlay for your specific location.
- **Cheap Gear:** Forget your umbrella? Every **FamilyMart** sells reliable ones for ~30 RMB. Avoid buying them from street vendors at 3x the price during rain.
