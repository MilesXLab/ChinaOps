# 🛫 The Landing Protocol: First 30 Minutes

**TL;DR:** Don't leave the airport until your "Digital Life" is stable. Airport Wi-Fi is your last "safe hub" with high bandwidth.

**Prerequisites:**
- Passport (at least 6 months validity).
- Physical Credit Card (Visa/Mastercard).
- Phone with Roaming or pre-installed eSIM.
- Address of your first hotel in **Chinese characters**.

## The Sequence (Order of Operations)

### 1. The Immigration Queue (The Digital Card SOP)
- **Step:** Since Nov 2025, the **Digital Arrival Card** is mandatory. Do not wait until the line to fill it. Use the kiosks *before* the main line.
- **Action:** Scan your passport at the kiosk and it will pull your pre-filled data from the **Alipay** "Digital Entry Card" mini-program.
- **Verification:** Ensure you get the thermal paper receipt with the "Verified" timestamp.
- **Fallback:** If the system is offline, physical **Blue/Yellow paper cards** are typically available on nearby desks. Grab one immediately and fill by hand to avoid losing your spot in line.

### 2. The Connectivity Check
- **Step:** Disable your home SIM's "Data Roaming" unless you have a global plan. Switch to your **Travel eSIM** (Airalo/Yesim/3HK).
- **Verification:** Open `google.com`. If it loads, your eSIM is successfully bypassing the firewall.
- **Fallback:** If eSIM fails, connect to **Airport Free Wi-Fi**. It usually requires a SMS code (which works on foreign numbers) or a Passport scan at a kiosk.

### 3. The "Cold Start" Payment Test
- **Step:** Go to the airport's FamilyMart, Lawson, or Starbucks. Buy a small item (water/coffee).
- **Verification:** Pay using **Alipay** (linked to your foreign card). 
- **Fallback:** If Alipay fails, use your **Physical Credit Card**. If that fails, go to the **Bank of China (BOC) ATM** in the arrival hall and withdraw 500 RMB.

### 4. The Exit & Transport
- **Step:** Download the **DiDi (International)** app or use the "Transport" mini-program inside Alipay.
- **Verification:** If the app shows your location correctly on the map, you're good.
- **Fallback:** Follow the signs to the **Official Taxi Stand**. Never, ever follow a "driver" who approaches you in the hall saying "Taxi? Cheap!" (The Black Cab Trap).

## TechDad's Tips (Landing Reality)

- **The "Screenshot everything" Rule:** Grab screenshots of your hotel booking, your passport photo page, and your return flight. You will inevitably lose signal in a tunnel or elevator precisely when you need them.
- **Power Bank Paradox:** If you need a power bank from a kiosk, you need a working phone to scan it. If your phone is at 5%, find a physical outlet in the airport (usually near the seats) before leaving.
- **The "Small Bill" Strategy:** ATMs give 100 RMB notes. FamilyMart is your "Money Changer." Buy a 3 RMB water to get 10s and 20s. Taxis love small change if their digital payment glitches.

## Verification Loop
1. [ ] eSIM Data? (Check Google/WhatsApp)
2. [ ] Payment? (Try a small purchase)
3. [ ] Transport? (App location set)
4. [ ] Offline Proof? (Hotel address screenshot)

**If all 4 are [X], you are cleared to leave the airport.**
