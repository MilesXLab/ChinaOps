## Problem
Foreign travelers struggle to activate mobile phone services, receive verification codes for apps, and navigate Chinese carrier requirements without proper ID documentation.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

- **ID requirements:** Carriers require ID verification (passport for foreigners).
- **Age verification:** WeChat, Alipay, and many apps require SMS verification with local number.
- **Registration system:** Carriers have strict real-name registration rules (实名制 shíming zhì).
- **SIM binding:** Once registered to a number, changing SIM or porting is complex.
- **Foreigner restrictions:** Some carriers limit foreign ID document acceptance.

## Miles' Tips

- 📱 **Get SIM immediately upon arrival** — Don't wait until hotel. Airport SIM is convenient, though expensive.
- 🔌 **Ask for 4G/5G data plan** — Specify "4G" or "5G" (四G/五G) to ensure modern speeds.
- 💳 **Link to payment immediately** — Once you get SMS verification, set up Alipay/WeChat same day.
- 🔄 **Keep backup eSIM active** — If physical SIM fails, switch to eSIM (eSIM backup provides redundancy).
- 📞 **Write down your number** — Carry written copy of your Chinese number for emergencies.
- 🆔 **Keep passport copy accessible** — You may need to show it multiple times during SIM activation.
- ⏰ **Activate apps before traveling to remote areas** — Mountain regions have spotty coverage; test in advance.

❌ Buy SIM without proper ID (won't activate)  
❌ Activate multiple SIM cards under same passport (possible tracking issues)  
❌ Assume eSIM is accepted everywhere (some apps require local carrier SIM)  
❌ Forget to top-up data if you buy pay-as-you-go plan
