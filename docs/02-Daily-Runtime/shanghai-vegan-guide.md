# Shanghai Vegetarian & Vegan Survival

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

### Context
Shanghai is the most vegan-friendly city in China. Traditional Chinese "Zhai Cai" (Buddhist temple food) is often naturally vegan. However, hidden ingredients like oyster sauce, chicken broth, or animal fat (lard) are common in standard restaurants. This guide provides the "patches" needed for a successful plant-based trip.

## 1. The Vegan "Environment Variable"

Managing expectations and identifying hidden meat products.

| Category | Status | Technical Advice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temple Food** | **Safe** | Naturally vegan, but check for "pungent" plants (garlic/onions) if you're strict. |
| **Hole-in-the-Wall**| **Warning** | Likely use lard for frying or meat broth for noodles. |
| **Shopping Malls** | **Safe** | High-end malls (IFC, IAPM, K11) almost always have dedicated vegan nodes. |
| **Delivery Apps** | **High Availability** | Meituan/Ele.me have excellent "Vegetarian" filters. |

## 2. Critical Phrases & Logic

Show these to your waiter to "patch" your order:

- **"I am vegetarian"**: 我是素食者 (Wǒ shì sùshí zhě)
- **"Strict Vegan (No egg/milk)"**: 纯素 / 无蛋奶 (Chún sù / Wú dàn nǎi)
- **"No Meat/Egg/Milk/Onions/Garlic"**: 无肉 / 无蛋 / 无奶 / 无葱蒜 (Wú ròu / Wú dàn / Wú nǎi / Wú cōng suàn)
- **"Please don't use oyster sauce or meat broth"**: 请不要放蚝油或肉汤 (Qǐng bùyào fàng háoyóu huò ròu tāng)

## 5. Apps & Tools

- **HappyCow** (Verified Jan 2026, v75.0): Most accurate for Shanghai, updated by expat community
- **Dianping (大众点评)** (Verified Jan 2026, v12.3): Search "素食" or "vegan", look for "必吃榜" medals
- **Meituan/Ele.me** (Verified Jan 2026): Use "素食" filter for delivery

## TechDad's Tips

- **The "HappyCow" Failover:** While local apps like Dianping are great, **HappyCow** is still highly accurate for Shanghai and updated by the local expat community. Use it to find hidden vegan cafes in the Former French Concession.
- **Double Check the Dumpling:** Street-side "Vegetable Dumplings" (菜包) often contain egg. If you are vegan, specifically ask for "Chun Su" (纯素/无蛋).
- **Supermarket Scans:** Use **Hema (盒马)** for plant-based milks and vegan snacks. They have a dedicated "Organic/Healthy" section.
- **Crab Season Alternative:** During hairy crab season (Oct-Nov), many vegan restaurants offer creative "素蟹黄" (vegan crab roe) dishes.

### Local Hacks & Summary
- **The "Baozi" Hack:** If you're in a rush, look for **mushroom and green vegetable buns** (香菇菜包). They are usually vegan and very cheap (3-4 RMB).
- **Morning Coffee:** Oat milk ("燕麦奶" Yànmài nǎi) is available in almost every **Starbucks, Manner, or Luckin Coffee** in Shanghai.
- **Budget Meal:** 7-Eleven and FamilyMart have vegan onigiri (rice balls) and salads clearly marked.
