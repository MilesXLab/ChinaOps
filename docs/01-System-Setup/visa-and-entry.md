# Visa & Entry Requirements (2026 Update)

**Last Updated:** Jan 26, 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

**TL;DR:** Many European and Asian countries now enjoy **30-day visa-free entry** until Dec 31, 2026. US/UK/Canada usually still require a visa or can use the **144-hour (or 240-hour)** Transit Visa-Free (TWOV).

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites
- **Passport:** Minimum 6 months validity from date of entry.
- **Onward Ticket:** If using Transit Visa-Free (TWOV).
- **Hotel Address:** In Chinese characters (for the entry card).

---

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. Check Eligibility (The "Is it Free?" Flow)
- **30-Day Visa-Free (Pilot):** Citizens of **Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and Sweden**. 
- **Canada Alert:** As of Jan 2026, Canada is anticipated to be added to the 30-day visa-free list shortly. Check official NIA notices before booking.
- **144/240-Hour Transit Visa:** For US and UK citizens (and Canadians if the pilot hasn't started). 
  - **Rule:** You must be flying to a *third* country (e.g., NYC -> Shanghai -> Tokyo).
- **Verification:** Check the latest list on [en.nia.gov.cn](https://en.nia.gov.cn).

### 2. The Digital Entry Card (Mandatory Nov 2025+)
- **Step:** The traditional paper card is being phased out in favor of the **Digital Arrival Card** launched in late 2025. 
- **Action:** Fill it out in the **Alipay** app (search "Digital Entry Card") before you board.
- **Verification:** Receive a QR code. **Screenshot it immediately.** You will need it to "Self-Serve" through the kiosks at arrival.

## 3. Verification Loop (At the Border)
- [ ] Scan QR code at the kiosk.
- [ ] Print the "Verified" slip.
- [ ] Submit slip and passport to the officer.
- [ ] Receive entry stamp (Check it! Ensure the date is correct).

---

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)
- **Kiosk is Down:** Look for physical **Blue/Yellow paper cards** on the tables. They are still kept as a legacy backup.
- **Dispute at Border:** Call the NIA Hotline **12367**. They have 24/7 English support and can resolve visa-free eligibility disputes on the spot.
- **Lost Proof:** If your digital booking won't load, use your **Offline Screenshots** of the hotel confirmation.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "Transit" Trap:** Hong Kong and Taiwan count as "Third Countries" for the 144/240-hour TWOV. A trip like London -> Shanghai -> Hong Kong is a valid "Third Country" transit.
- **Purpose of Stay:** Keep it simple: **"Tourism"**. Avoid saying "Business" unless you have an official invitation letter, or you'll trigger an unnecessary audit.
- **Registration Hack:** If staying with friends, you **must** register at a police station within 24 hours. Many cities like Shanghai now allow this via a **"Self-help Declaration"** WeChat mini-program. Ask your host for the QR code.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Relying on airport Wi-Fi to load your "Digital Entry Card." 
- **Hotfix:** Always have the QR code and your hotel address as an **offline photo**.
