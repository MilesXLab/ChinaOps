# 🏮 2026 China Holiday Survival SOP

**TL;DR:** Avoid travel during **Feb 15–23 (CNY)** and **Oct 1–7 (National Day)** unless you enjoy extreme crowds. Book HSR tickets exactly 15 days in advance. Stock up on supplies 3 days *before* CNY starts.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Booking Hub:** Trip.com (with pre-filled passport data).
- **Redundancy:** At least two VPNs (LetsVPN + backup).
- **Physical Cash:** 500 RMB (as many small vendors close and digital systems lag).

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The 15-Day Booking Protocol
- **Step 1:** Identify your travel date. Count back exactly 15 days.
- **Step 2:** Log in to **12306** or **Trip.com** at 10:00 AM / 2:00 PM (check specific station release times).
- **Verification:** Secure a "Waitlist" (后补 hòubǔ) spot immediately if tickets are sold out.
- **Action:** If rail is dead, pivot to **Domestic Flights**. They are the only stable "failover" for Golden Week.

### 2. Supply Chain Hardening (CNY Special)
- **Step 1:** Purchase 7 days of baby formula, diapers, and maintenance medication by **Feb 12, 2026**.
- **Step 2:** Meituan/Ele.me riders drop by 80% during the Spring Festival. Do not rely on 30-min delivery.
- **Verification:** Confirm your neighborhood **ALDI** or **Hema** operating hours; they are the only nodes that stay open.

### 3. Crowd Management (Anti-Collision)
- **Step 1:** Be at attraction gates (Disney, Great Wall) **45 mins before opening**.
- **Step 2:** Use **Shared Bikes** (HelloBike/Meituan) to bypass the 60+ min Didi wait times in tourist districts.
- **Verification:** Check the "Live Population Heatmap" in Baidu Maps to see if an area is "Red" (avoid).

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If you are stranded in a 100,000+ person crowd (e.g., The Bund):
1. **The "Inner Street" Exit:** Do not follow the main flow. Pivot into smaller side streets (Li long) to find a way out of the police cordons.
2. **Station Lockdown:** During peak hours, some Metro stations (like East Nanjing Road) close entirely. **Action:** Walk to the next station 15-20 mins away.
3. **Emergency Shelter:** If the crowd is overwhelming, find a **5-star hotel lobby**. Safety is their priority; they won't kick a family with a stroller out of the lobby.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "Reverse Travel" Pulse:** During CNY, Tier-1 cities (Shanghai/Beijing) are actually *quieter* than normal as people go home. It's the best time for city-walks if you don't mind cold weather.
- **The "調休" (Working Weekends) Trap:** Check if your "Sunday" is actually a working day. The government shifts weekends to create long holidays. Apps like **Alipay** have a built-in calendar for this.
- **Security Logic:** Police presence is 500% higher during holidays. It's the safest time to be out, but also the most regulated. Follow the megaphone instructions.
