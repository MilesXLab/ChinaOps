# 📜 Lost Passport Restoration SOP

**TL;DR:** Report to the nearest police station immediately to get a "Receipt of Report." Contact your Embassy for a Travel Document. Do not leave the city until you have the replacement.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Digital Copies:** Passport photo page and Chinese Visa/Entry stamp (stored in cloud/offline).
- **Physical Address:** Your current hotel/residence address.
- **Photos:** 2-4 passport-sized photos on a white background.

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The Police "Hotfix"
- **Step 1:** Go to the police station (派出所 Pàichūsuǒ) in the district where you lost the passport.
- **Step 2:** Request a **"Receipt of Report of Lost/Stolen Passport."** You need this for the embassy and the exit visa.
- **Verification:** Ensure the receipt has an official red stamp (公章 Gōngzhāng).

### 2. The Embassy / Consulate Request
- **Step 1:** Call your embassy's 24/7 emergency line.
- **Step 2:** Apply for an **"Emergency Travel Document"** (usually a purple or temporary passport).
- **Verification:** Check if the Travel Document allows you to travel *out* of China or just back to your home country.

### 3. The Exit Visa (The Final Patch)
- **Step 1:** Take your new Travel Document and the Police Receipt to the local **Exit-Entry Administration** (出入境管理局).
- **Step 2:** Apply for a replacement visa or an exit permit.
- **Verification:** You cannot board an international flight without this new visa, even with the travel document.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If you lose your passport right before a train/flight:
1. **Station Police:** Go to the Railway Station Police booth with your digital passport copy. They can issue a **24-hour Temporary Identity Certificate** for train travel only.
2. **Hotel Check-in:** Small hotels may reject you without a physical passport. Go to a **branded international hotel** (Marriott, Hilton); their systems are more flexible for emergency cases if you have a police report.
3. **No Money?** If your wallet was also lost, use **Alipay's "Emergency Assistance"** or contact your embassy for a small emergency loan.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "Cloud Vault":** Keep a photo of your entry stamp. The Exit-Entry bureau will ask for the exact date and location of your last entry.
- **Police Language Barrier:** Use a translation app to say: "Wǒ de hùzhào diūle" (My passport is lost). They will handle the rest.
- **Photocopies are Life:** Keep a physical photocopy of your passport in a separate bag from the original.
