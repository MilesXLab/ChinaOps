# Mobile Phone Number & Activation

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

---

## Problem
Foreign travelers struggle to activate mobile phone services, receive verification codes for apps, and navigate Chinese carrier requirements without proper ID documentation.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

- **ID requirements:** Carriers require ID verification (passport for foreigners).
- **Age verification:** WeChat, Alipay, and many apps require SMS verification with local number.
- **Registration system:** Carriers have strict real-name registration rules (实名制 shíming zhì).
- **SIM binding:** Once registered to a number, changing SIM or porting is complex.
- **Foreigner restrictions:** Some carriers limit foreign ID document acceptance.

## Solution (Step-by-Step)

### Option A: eSIM (Easiest, Recommended for Short Trips)

**Providers:**
1. **Airalo** (International eSIM)
   - No registration required
   - Activate online before arrival
   - Price: $10-20 for 10GB/week
   - Best for: 1-2 week trips

2. **Nomad SIM**
   - Similar to Airalo
   - Good coverage, 4G speeds
   - Price: $8-15 for 8GB

**How to activate:**
1. Download Airalo app before trip
2. Purchase eSIM plan ($10-20)
3. Scan QR code in app to activate on phone

**Limitation:** Some apps (like DingTalk for business) require local carrier SIM, not eSIM.

## Miles' Tips

- **Get SIM immediately upon arrival** — Don't wait until hotel. Airport SIM is convenient, though expensive.
- **Ask for 4G/5G data plan** — Specify "4G" or "5G" (四G/五G) to ensure modern speeds.
- **Link to payment immediately** — Once you get SMS verification, set up Alipay/WeChat same day.
- **Keep backup eSIM active** — If physical SIM fails, switch to eSIM (eSIM backup provides redundancy).
- **Write down your number** — Carry written copy of your Chinese number for emergencies.
- **Keep passport copy accessible** — You may need to show it multiple times during SIM activation.
- **Activate apps before traveling to remote areas** — Mountain regions have spotty coverage; test in advance.

## What NOT to Do

- Try to use foreign number for Chinese app verification (won't work)
- Buy SIM without proper ID (won't activate)
- Activate multiple SIM cards under same passport (possible tracking issues)
- Assume eSIM is accepted everywhere (some apps require local carrier SIM)
- Forget to top-up data if you buy pay-as-you-go plan

## Recommendations

### For Different Trip Lengths

**1-3 days:**
- Use eSIM (Airalo) only
