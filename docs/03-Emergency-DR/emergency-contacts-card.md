## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If your phone is dead and you need help:
1. **The "Luxury Hotel" Hub:** Find the nearest 5-star hotel (Marriott, Hyatt, etc.). Their concierge staff are trained to help foreigners in emergencies.
2. **Police Kiosks:** Look for small, lit police booths (often near metro stations or major intersections). 
3. **The "Stranger" Protocol:** Show a local person your hotel card and say **"Help"**. Chinese citizens are generally very helpful to foreigners in obvious distress.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **Pin the Embassy:** Before you leave the airport, "Star" your country's consulate (USA, UK, Australia, etc.) in your map app.
- **Save to Favorites:** Put the number **12367** in your phone contacts as "China Visa Support."
- **The "Screenshot" Vault:** Create a dedicated album in your phone photos called "EMERGENCY" containing your passport, visa, and insurance policy.
- **Battery is Life:** Your phone is your wallet, map, and ID. If it's below 10%, you are in a "Critical State." Use Plan B (Luxury Hotel) to charge.
