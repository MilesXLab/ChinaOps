# ✈️ The Transit Protocol: International to Domestic

**TL;DR:** Pre-clear your **Digital Entry Card**. Allow at least **3.5 hours** for transit. You **must** pick up your luggage and re-check it; there is no "automatic" through-check for international arrivals in 2026.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Onward Flight Booking:** Digital or paper.
- **Digital Entry QR Code:** Screenshot from Alipay.
- **Physical Stamina:** Shanghai (PVG) Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 is a 15-minute walk.

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The Immigration Sprint
- **Step:** Do not stop for currency exchange or SIM cards yet. Head straight to the **Digital Entry Card** kiosks.
- **Verification:** Ensure you have your luggage claim tags ready.
- **Action:** If the line looks >45 minutes, look for the **"Express Transit"** lane if you have a connecting flight in under 2 hours.

### 2. The Luggage Loop (Crucial)
- **Step:** You **must** go to the baggage claim and retrieve every checked bag. Even if the tag says "Final Destination," it will not clear customs without you.
- **Step:** Take bags through the "Nothing to Declare" (Green) or "Goods to Declare" (Red) channel.
- **Verification:** Ensure you have all bags before heading to the "Domestic Departures" level.

### 3. Re-Check & Security
- **Step:** Head to the Domestic Departure counters (e.g., PVG T2 for China Eastern). 
- **Step:** Re-scan your power banks at security. **Critical Alert:** Ensure your power bank capacity is clearly labeled (<160Wh). If not labeled, security *will* confiscate it.
- **Verification:** Confirm your gate number on the big board (gate changes are frequent).

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If your flight is delayed and you have <60 mins:
1. **Find "Ground Service" (地面服务):** Look for staff with "Connecting Flights" signs at the air bridge. They can sometimes guide you through a VIP transit lane.
2. **Re-booking Logic:** If you miss the flight, go to the airline's **Ticket Counter**. Most domestic carriers will put you on the next flight for free if the delay was on their end, but you'll need your 12306 app or booking ID.
3. **Emergency Hotel:** If stuck overnight, ask the airline for a **"Stayover Voucher"**. Many offer free 3-star hotel stays for missed connections.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The Terminal Shuttle:** Don't wait for the shuttle bus between Terminal 1 and 2 if you are in a rush; the **Moving Walkway** is often faster and more predictable.
- **Battery Rules:** Keep all lithium batteries in your **Carry-on**. If found in checked bags during the domestic re-check, they will be removed and you won't be notified until you land.
- **Food Strategy:** Eat at the airport *before* you clear domestic security. The options "inside" are often limited to instant noodles or overpriced fast food.
