# 👁️ Visual Signs & Symbols Reconnaissance

**TL;DR:** Red "M" = Metro. `出口` (Chūkǒu) = Exit. `卫生间` (Wèishēngjiān) = Toilet. `公章` (Red Stamp) = Official Document. Use your camera translator for anything else.

**Prerequisites:**
- **App:** Google Translate (Camera Mode) or Pleco (OCR).
- **Physical ID:** Passport (to match your face with the "Face Scan" signs).

## 📋 The Visual Runbook

### 1. Transit & Navigation

| **出口** | **EXIT** | Follow the numbers (1, 2, 3) to reach specific street corners. |
| **入口** | **ENTRANCE** | Security check is mandatory for all baggage. |
| **出租车** | **TAXI** | Only queue at the official rank. |

### 2. Hygiene & Baby Care
| Sign | Meaning | SRE Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **母婴室** | **NURSING** | The "Golden Hub" for parents. High reliability in malls. |
| **无障碍** | **ACCESSIBLE** | Use these for strollers (elevators, wide gates). |

### 3. Official & Emergency

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If you see a sign you don't understand and it looks critical:
1. **The "Scan & Patch" SOP:** Open Google Translate. Hold the camera up to the sign. It will "AR-overlay" the translation.
2. **Contextual Logic:** If the sign is Red and has an exclamation mark (!), it's a **Blocker**. Stop and verify before proceeding.
3. **The "Local Observer" Trick:** Watch what the locals are doing. If they are all swiping their phones at a specific gate, it's a **System Requirement**.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "Red Stamp" (Gōngzhāng):** In China, a red circular stamp is the only thing that makes a document "Official." An ink signature alone is often rejected.
- **Exit Numbers:** In Shanghai Metro, a station might have 20 exits. **Always** check the map for the specific Exit Number (e.g., "Exit 4") before you go up the escalator.
- **Color Coding:** 
  - **Green:** Safety / Exit.
  - **Red:** Warning / Metro entrance.
  - **Blue:** Information / Direction.
- **Waimai Scooters:** Watch for the blue (Ele.me) or yellow (Meituan) uniforms. They are the fastest and most dangerous "objects" in the environment.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Relying on English subtitles on signs. 
- **Hotfix:** Outside of central Shanghai (Jing'an/Xuhui), English subtitles disappear or are mistranslated. Rely on the **Icons** and the **Camera Translator**.
