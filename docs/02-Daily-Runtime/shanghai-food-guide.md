# 🥟 Shanghai Food & Dining SOP

**TL;DR:** Use **Dianping** to find restaurants and buy vouchers. Master the **Xiaolongbao** technique (soup first). Stick to **Hema/ALDI** for safe, clean, pre-packaged meals.

**Prerequisites:**
- **App:** Dianping (大众点评) for reviews, Meituan for delivery.
- **Mental Model:** "Eat where the queue is long."
- **Translation:** `我对花生/海鲜过敏` (I am allergic to peanuts/seafood) screenshot.

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The "Dumpling" Protocol
- **A. Xiaolongbao (Soup Dumplings):** 
  - **Step:** Place on a flat spoon, poke a hole to drain steam, drink the soup, then eat. 
  - **Top Node:** **Jia Jia Tang Bao** (People's Square).
- **B. Shengjianbao (Pan-fried Buns):** 
  - **Step:** Bite the corner carefully. The bottom is crispy, the top is soft.
  - **Top Node:** **Da Hu Chun** or **Yang’s**.
- **Verification:** No burnt tongues or soup-sprayed shirts.

### 2. Dining Selection using "Dianping"
- **Step 1:** Open Dianping. Look for the **"Must-Eat" (必吃榜)** or **"Black Pearl" (黑珍珠)** awards.
- **Step 2:** Check the **"Tuan gou"** (团购) tab for discount sets.
- **Step 3:** Show the waiter the **Photos** of dishes to avoid translation errors.
- **Verification:** Confirm the price in the app before you pay at the counter.

### 3. The Delivery Failover (Meituan/Ele.me)
- **Step 1:** If tired, order via **Meituan**. 
- **Step 2:** Search for your hotel name. Meet the rider in the lobby (most hotels don't allow riders up elevators).
- **Verification:** Check the tamper-evident seal before opening.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If you are in a neighborhood with no English menus and no signal:
1. **The "Display Cabinet" Strategy:** Many local eateries have their ingredients or dishes in a display case. Point and gesture.
2. **Chain Nodes:** Look for **Saizeriya** (Italian), **Ajisen Ramen**, or **McDonald's**. They have predictable quality and picture-based ordering.
3. **The "Hema" Buffet:** Go to a **Hema (Freshippo)** supermarket. They have a massive cooked-food section where you can pick exactly what you want and pay via Alipay.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "Elders" Rule:** If you see a line of local retirees at a hole-in-the-wall at 8:00 AM, the food is authentic, cheap, and safe.
- **Hot Tea:** Most traditional places provide free hot tea. It's the local "antiseptic" and much better than cold soda.
- **Hairy Crab Season:** If visiting in Oct/Nov, focus your spending here. It's the highlight of the Shanghai culinary calendar.
- **Table Manners:** Don't stick your chopsticks vertically in a bowl of rice (it's a funeral ritual). Lay them across the bowl or on the rest provided.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Ordering spicy food without a "Mild" fallback. 
- **Hotfix:** Always say **"Bù là"** (Not spicy) or **"Wēi là"** (Lightly spicy) even if you like spice—Chinese "Medium" is often "Extreme" by Western standards.
