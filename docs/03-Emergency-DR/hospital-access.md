# 🏥 Hospital & Medical Care: The Recovery SOP

**TL;DR:** For emergencies, head to **Jiahui International** or **United Family**. Public hospitals are extremely crowded during Feb 2026 due to flu/HMPV peaks. Carry your **physical passport**; digital will not work for registration.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Passport:** Original physical document (mandatory for all patients).
- **Insurance Card:** Both digital and physical copies.
- **Payment:** Alipay/WeChat with at least 2,000 RMB balance (for non-direct billing cases).

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. Triage: Choosing the Node
- **Option A (International):** Use **Jiahui** or **United Family**. These are 24/7 stable nodes with English-speaking staff and direct billing.
- **Option B (Public VIP):** Use **Ruijin VIP** or **Huashan Worldwide**. Cheaper, but "Payment First" logic applies.
- **Action:** Call the hospital hotline *before* leaving to check if the "Fever Clinic" (发热门诊) is at max capacity.

### 2. Registration & "Loop" Execution
- **Step 1:** Present passport at the "Gua hao" (挂号) window.
- **Step 2:** Pay the initial consultation fee (150 - 2,000 RMB depending on hospital tier).
- **Step 3 (The Public Loop):** If at a public hospital, you must pay for *each* lab test or prescription *before* it is dispensed. Go to the "Cashier" (收费处) window after every doctor instruction.
- **Verification:** You are successful once you have the physical "Prescription" (处方单) and a stamped receipt.

### 3. Verification Loop (Medication)
- [ ] Check Pinyin: **yìbùqiūfēn** (Ibuprofen) or **duìyǐxi酰ànjiǎonà** (Paracetamol).
- [ ] Verify if the drug requires refrigeration (common with 2026 cold-chain meds).

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If International Hospitals are full or out of network:
1. **Telemedicine (Mobile-First):** Many clinics offer **video consults** via WeChat Mini-programs. If it's a simple rash or refilling a non-controlled med, this avoids the 3-hour waiting room.
2. **24H Pharmacy Delivery:** Use **Meituan** or **Ele.me**. Search `24H 药店`. Most can deliver basic fever meds within 60 minutes.
3. **Emergency (120):** If you cannot speak Chinese, say **"Wǒ yào qù Jiāhuì Yīyuàn"** (I want to go to Jiahui Hospital) to the ambulance crew. They generally know the international nodes.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The Feb 2026 "Tri-demic":** Be aware that Feb 2026 is a peak for **Flu, HMPV, and Mycoplasma**. Fever clinics will be overflowing. Avoid public hospitals unless it's a trauma emergency.
- **Stroller-Friendly ERs:** Jiahui and United Family have dedicated stroller parking and wide elevators. Public VIP wings can be very cramped.
- **Language Hack:** Download a photo of common symptoms (Fever, Cough, Diarrhea) to point at if the doctor's English is limited. 
- **Air Quality Alert:** High AQI during winter can trigger asthma. Ensure your **Inhaler** is in your "Go-bag."
