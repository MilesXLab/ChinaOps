# 🗺️ Maps & Public Toilets SOP

**TL;DR:** Use **Amap (Gao-de)** for navigation; Google Maps is 20-50m shifted due to encryption. Search `厕所` (Cè suǒ) for toilets. Malls (IFC, IAPM) always have "Premium" toilets.

**Prerequisites:**
- **App:** Amap (高德地图) or Baidu Maps.
- **Offline Data:** Pre-download the "Shanghai" or "Beijing" city data within the map app.
- **Supply:** Carry a small pack of tissues (some public toilets run out).

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. Navigation: The "Anti-Shift" Protocol
- **Step 1:** Do not use Google Maps for walking directions—it has a "Coordinate Shift" that will lead you to the wrong side of a 6-lane road.
- **Step 2:** Open **Amap** (Gao-de). Use the camera translation feature in Google Translate to understand the Chinese menu if needed, but the "Blue Dot" and "Arrow" logic is universal.
- **Verification:** Your "Blue Dot" should be exactly on the street you are standing on.

### 2. The "Emergency" Toilet Sweep
- **Step 1:** Open your map app. Search for `厕所` (Cè suǒ) or `公共厕所`.
- **Step 2:** Look for the nearest **High-End Mall** (e.g., K11, Reel, IAPM). These are the "Tier-1" nodes for hygiene.
- **Step 3:** Navigate to the **B1 or 4F** levels; they are usually quieter and cleaner than the ground floor.
- **Verification:** Public toilets in China are **100% Free**. If someone asks for money, you are probably at a non-official tourist gimmick.

### 3. The "Nursing Room" Protocol
- **Step 1 (Parent Patch):** Search for `母婴室` (Mǔ yīng shì). 
- **Step 2:** In major malls, these are hotel-quality with change tables and nursing chairs.
- **Verification:** Look for the "Bottle/Baby" icon outside the restroom area.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If you have no data and need a toilet:
1. **The Fast Food Node:** Look for a **McDonald's** or **KFC**. They are ubiquitous "Safe Hubs" with free-access toilets.
2. **5-Star Hotel Lobby:** Walk confidently into any high-end hotel lobby. Restrooms are usually located near the ballroom or the lounge area.
3. **Public Transit Hubs:** Every Metro station has a toilet. Note: They are often *inside* the ticket gates. You may need to tap-in (2 RMB) to access them.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **Paper Protocol:** Most public toilets in 2026 have facial-recognition paper dispensers. If you see a weird screen, just stand in front of it and it will spit out a short roll. 
- **Squat vs. Sit:** Most public toilets have one "Western" (sitting) stall and several "Squat" stalls. Look for the sign on the door. The Western stall is often used by mothers or the elderly.
- **Sanitizer:** Always carry hand sanitizer. Soap dispensers in public street toilets are hit-or-miss.
- **The "Smart Map" Hack:** Amap has a "Toilet Heatmap" that tells you how many stalls are currently vacant in major public facilities.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Relying on street signs for "Restroom."
- **Hotfix:** Traditional street signs for toilets can be outdated or leading to a nearby "Hutong" toilet which might be too "authentic" for international travelers. Stick to Mall nodes.
