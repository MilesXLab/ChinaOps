# Maps & Toilet Locations

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

### Problem
Tourists cannot find toilets or locate attractions quickly.

### Root Cause
- Public toilets not consistently labeled in English.  
- Foreign maps may not show local pedestrian shortcuts.

### Fix / Solution
- Use Baidu Maps / Amap with English overlay.  
- Identify “restrooms” in advance on map pins.

### Miles’ Tips
- Public toilets in cities and tourist areas are **totally free**.
- High-standard restrooms are easily found in shopping malls (like IFS, IAPM, K11) and major hotels.
- Most public toilets now provide free toilet paper via dispensers, but it's wise to carry a small pack of tissues as a backup.

### Recommendations
- Apps: Baidu Maps (English mode), Amap (高德地图)
- No small change needed; public toilets in China are free of charge.

### Local Hacks / Money-saving Tips
- Take ferry rides (2 RMB) across Huangpu River for sightseeing.  
- **Safety Hack:** Do not drink tap water. Buy bottled water at 7-11 or FamilyMart for drinking.
