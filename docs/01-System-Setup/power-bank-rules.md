# Hardware Patches: Power Banks & Gear

**Last Updated:** Jan 23, 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

### Problem
Power banks are the "fuel" for your China trip. If your battery dies, your wallet (Alipay), map, and translator die too. However, Chinese transport security (HSR & Airports) is zero-tolerance.

## 🔋 Power Bank "Safety" Rules

### 1. The Capacity Limit
- **Max:** **20,000mAh (100Wh)**. Anything higher (like 30k+ laptop banks) will be confiscated at airport security.
- **The "3C" Seal:** Your battery **MUST** have the "3C" logo or the capacity (Wh/mAh) clearly printed on the casing.
- **Wear & Tear Warning:** If the text is scratched off or unreadable due to use, security will likely put it in the trash. **If you can't read the specs, neither can they.**

### 2. Recommended Brands
- **Reliable Nodes:** Stick to **Anker**, **Xiaomi (Mi)**, or **Baseus**. These have unambiguous labeling and high-quality cells.

## ☔ The "Hardware" Checklist

### 1. The Umbrella Patch
Shanghai weather is highly unstable. A light, foldable umbrella is not just for rain; it's a vital patch for the harsh summer sun. Carry one in your day-pack.

### 2. The Universal Adapter
China uses **Type A, C, and I**. Most hotel outlets are "universal," but bringing an adapter ensures you can charge at airport lounges or high-speed rail seats.

## Miles' Tips

- ⚡ **The "Circular Dependency" Error:** Do not let your phone hit 0%. You cannot rent a shared power bank (Meituan/Alipay) if your phone is already dead because you need to scan a QR code to release the bank.
- 🧳 **Carry-on ONLY:** Power banks must **never** be in checked luggage. They must be in your carry-on for security screening.
- 🚆 **Station Security:** Train station security (HSR) is just as strict as airports. Be ready to take your power bank out of your bag for inspection.

### Local Hacks & Money-saving Tips
- **HSR Charging:** Almost all G-Trains (High-Speed) have power outlets under the seat (front or back). Look for the little green light.
- **Airport Charging:** Major airports like PVG have "Quick Charge" stations, but they often require a local phone number. Stick to your own portable bank for "high availability."
