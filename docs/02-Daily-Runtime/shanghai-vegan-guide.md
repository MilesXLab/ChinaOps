# 🥗 Vegetarian & Vegan Survival SOP

**TL;DR:** Use **HappyCow** or **Dianping** (search `素食`). Stick to **Buddhist Temple Restaurants** for 100% plant-based purity. Avoid street-food "vegetable" buns as they often contain lard or egg.

**Prerequisites:**
- **App:** HappyCow (Update v75.0+) or Dianping.
- **Translation:** `我是纯素食者，不吃肉、蛋、奶、鱼露、蚝油` (I am a strict vegan, no meat, egg, milk, fish sauce, or oyster sauce).
- **Supply:** Carry a few vegan protein bars for Tier-3 city travel.

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. Sourcing Safe Nodes
- **Option A (The Temple Patch):** Head to **Longhua Temple** or **Jade Buddha Temple** restaurants. They are the "Gold Standard" for vegan purity.
- **Option B (The Mall Hub):** Malls like **K11**, **IAPM**, and **Reel** have dedicated vegan restaurants (e.g., *Fu He Hui*, *Qing Chun Pu Men*).
- **Verification:** Look for the **"素"** (Sù - Vegetarian) character on the menu.

### 2. The Ordering "Firewall"
- **Step 1:** Show your translation card to the waiter *immediately*.
- **Step 2:** Explicitly ask about **Lard (猪油)** and **Oyster Sauce (蚝油)**. Conventional Chinese kitchens use these as "default" ingredients.
- **Verification:** Ask: **"Shì bù shì chún sù de?"** (Is this strictly vegan?).

### 3. The Coffee Hub (Oat Milk)
- **Step 1:** Look for **Starbucks**, **Manner**, or **Luckin Coffee**.
- **Step 2:** Order `燕麦奶` (Yàn mài nǎi - Oat milk). 
- **Verification:** Confirm the "Oatly" or "Plant-based" sticker on the cup.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If you are in a non-vegan restaurant with no English:
1. **The "Clear Stir-fry" Hack:** Order `清炒时蔬` (Qīngchǎo shíshū - Clear stir-fry seasonal veg). Ask for **"Yòng zhíwùyóu"** (Use vegetable oil).
2. **The "Buddhist" Tofu Map:** Order `麻婆豆腐` (Mápó dòufu) but specify **"Bùyào ròumò"** (No minced meat). *Warning: Many places default to putting pork in tofu.*
3. **Convenience Store Hub:** Go to **FamilyMart** or **7-11**. Look for plain white rice balls (Onigiri), boiled corn, or sweet potatoes.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "Baozi" Warning:** Street-side "Vegetable Buns" (**Shūcài Bāo**) almost always contain egg or are steamed in the same baskets as meat buns. If you're strict, avoid them.
- **HappyCow accuracy:** In Shanghai, HappyCow is exceptionally well-maintained by the expat community. Trust it over TripAdvisor.
- **Hema Vegan:** **Hema (Freshippo)** supermarkets carry "Omnipork" and other plant-based meats if you're cooking at home.
- **Mushroom Logic:** For a high-end experience, **Fu He Hui** is a Michelin 2-star vegan experience. Book 2 weeks in advance.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Trusting "Vegetarian" icons on standard Chinese menus. 
- **Hotfix:** Always verbally verify with the server—Chinese "Vegetarian" sometimes allows for small amounts of meat as a "garnish" or seasoning (like lard).
