- **Step 2:** Show your **boarding pass** or e-ticket at the window. Cost drops from 50 to **40 RMB**.
- **Step 3:** Take the 8-minute ride to Longyang Rd.
- **Verification:** You are successful when you reach 431 km/h (peak times only) or 300 km/h (standard).

### 2. The 2 RMB "Skyline Cruise"
- **Step 1:** Head to the **Bund Ferry Terminal** (Waitan Ferry).

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If the Metro is too crowded (Peak 6 PM):
1. **Shared Bike Node:** Scan a **HelloBike** or **Meituan Bike** using your Alipay/Meituan app. It's often faster to cycle 2km than to wait for 3 Metro trains to pass.
2. **The "Mall Hub" Strategy:** If you're stuck in the rain or need a break, go to any **branded Mall** (IFC, IAPM, Reel). They have high-speed public Wi-Fi and the cleanest toilets in Asia.
3. **QR Order Failure:** If a restaurant's QR ordering system doesn't load your foreign card/account, ask for the **"Shiti Caidan"** (Physical Menu).

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The Stroller Elevator:** In the Metro, look for the **Blue Wheelchair Icon** on the floor. It points to the specific train door closest to the elevator at your destination station.
- **Coffee Culture:** Shanghai has more coffee shops than any other city. Use **Manner Coffee** for high-quality, budget beans (15-20 RMB) or **Starbucks** for the predictable Wi-Fi hub.
- **The "FamilyMart" Hack:** Need a quick, clean, hot lunch? FamilyMart's **Onigiri** and **Oden** are vetted by millions of commuters every day. Safe for sensitive stomachs.
- **PVG Security:** Give yourself 2.5 hours. PVG Terminal 2 security can be a massive bottleneck on Monday mornings.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Relying on the Maglev for an early morning flight (before 7:00 AM).
- **Hotfix:** The Maglev starts at 6:45 AM. If your flight is before 9 AM, take a **DiDi** instead to ensure you don't miss the check-in window.
