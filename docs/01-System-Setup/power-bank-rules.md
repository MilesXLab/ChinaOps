# 🔋 Power Bank & Hardware Rules

**TL;DR:** Max capacity **20,000mAh (100Wh)**. Labeling must be clearly visible. **Must be in carry-on.** Never let your phone hit 0% or you can't rent a shared bank.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Power Bank:** Brand-name (Anker/Xiaomi) with spec label intact.
- **Carry-on Bag:** Power banks are banned from checked luggage.

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The Capacity Audit (Pre-Flight)
- **Step 1:** Check the label on your power bank. If it says >100Wh or >27,000mAh (some airports use 100Wh as the hard limit), it will be confiscated. 
- **Step 2:** If the label is worn out or scratched, replace the bank. Security will not "guess" the capacity.
- **Verification:** Ensure the "3C" or "CE" logo is visible.

### 2. High-Speed Rail (HSR) Protocol
- **Step 1:** Be ready to pull the bank out at the station X-ray machine. 
- **Step 2:** Locate the power outlet under your seat (Standard and First Class have them).
- **Verification:** Confirm the green LED on the outlet is lit before plugging in.

### 3. Shared Power Bank Rental (The Recovery Hack)
- **Step 1:** Open Alipay or Meituan. Search `充电宝` (Power bank).
- **Step 2:** Scan the QR code on the machine (Meituan, Jiedian, or Energy Monster).
- **Verification:** The bank should pop out automatically.
- **Critical Alert:** You need at least 1-2% battery to perform this action. If your phone is dead, you're locked out of the shared economy.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If your power bank is confiscated at security:
1. **Airport Retail:** Go to a **Xiaomi (Mi)** or **Huawei** store inside the airport terminal. They sell compliant banks for ~150 RMB.
2. **Charging Poles:** Look for physical charging stations near the boarding gates. Note: These often require a USB-A cable; USB-C ports are less common in older terminals.
3. **Emergency Charge:** Ask the staff at a high-end cafe (Starbucks/Costa) if they have a "USB hub." Some will allow you to plug in for 10 mins if you buy a drink.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The Umbrella Patch:** Shanghai weather is erratic. Buy a small, manual foldable umbrella. Automatic ones are heavy and often break after one typhoon gust.
- **Type-C is Dominant:** While China used to be micro-USB heavy, everything in 2026 is Type-C. Ensure your "Go-bag" has at least two Type-C cables.
- **Don't Buy "Street" Banks:** Avoid buying power banks from non-branded kiosks or street vendors. They often have fake capacity labels and will be rejected at the airport next time you fly.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Relying on a single USB cable. 
- **Hotfix:** Keep a spare charging cable in your jacket pocket, separate from your main gear bag.
