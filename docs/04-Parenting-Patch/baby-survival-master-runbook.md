# 🍼 Baby & Toddler Survival Runbook

**TL;DR:** Never land without a 72-hour supply buffer. Use **Hema/Freshippo** for trusted formula. High-speed rail **First Class** is your "Nap Hub." Use **Manual Lanes** at all transit gates.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Child's Passport:** Physical original required for all hospital/hotel registration.
- **Supply Buffer:** 3 days of diapers and formula (redundancy against delivery delays).
- **Offline Card:** A physical card in the child's pocket with your phone number and hotel address in Chinese.

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The Supply Chain (Formula & Diapers)
- **Step 1:** Use **Hema (Freshippo)** or **Sam's Club** for buying formula. These are high-trust nodes.
- **Step 2:** For 30-min emergency delivery, use **Meituan** or **Ele.me**. Search: `奶粉` (Formula) or `纸尿裤` (Diapers).
- **Verification:** **Critical Alert (Nestlé Recall Jan 2026):** Check the batch number on the Nestlé official portal before feeding NAN/BEBA/Lactogen. If in doubt, switch to Aptamil.

### 2. The Pediatric Routing (Medical)
- **Step 1:** If your child has a fever > 38.5°C, head to **Jiahui International Hospital** (Shanghai) or the **VIP Wing** of a public pediatric hospital.
- **Step 2:** Say: **"Értóng fārè ménzhěn zài nǎlǐ?"** (Where is the pediatric fever clinic?).
- **Verification:** Ensure you have the child's physical passport. Digital copies are often rejected at the registration window.

### 3. Transit & Mobility SOP
- **Step 1 (Trains):** Book **First Class** on High-Speed Rail. The extra 30cm of legroom allows you to keep a stroller unfolded.
- **Step 2 (Metro):** Do not use e-gates. Go to the **Manual Lane** on the far end. Staff will wave strollers through.
- **Verification:** Check every carriage end for the **100°C Boiling Water Node** for sterilizing bottles.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If your luggage (with all supplies) is lost:
1. **The "Global Node" Strategy:** Head to **CitySuper** or **Ole' Supermarket**. They carry premium European/US brands (Pampers, Hipp, Aptamil) at a 40% markup, but quality is guaranteed.
2. **Medical Emergency outside SH/BJ:** If in a Tier 3 city, use **Baidu Maps** search for `三甲医院` (Grade A 3-Star Hospital). These are the most capable public hospitals.
3. **No Power Bank:** If your phone dies and you can't scan a power bank, go to the nearest **Luxury Hotel Front Desk**. Even if you aren't staying there, they will usually let you charge for 10 minutes at a "Power Hub."

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The Stroller Rule:** Leave the 15kg "Monster Stroller" at home. Bring a **lightweight cabin-fold stroller** (e.g., Babyzen YOYO). Chinese subways are 95% elevator-accessible, but that 5% will break your back.
- **Safe Havens (母婴室):** Shanghai malls like **Reel** or **IFC** have nursing rooms better than most hotel rooms. Use them.
- **Didi Car Seats:** They don't exist in 99% of cars. If you aren't bringing a car seat, use the **Metro** or **Official Taxis**; they are generally safer than unlicensed private drivers.
