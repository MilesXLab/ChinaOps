# 📱 Local Mobile Number SOP

**TL;DR:** Short-term travelers use **eSIM** (no KYC friction). Long-term residents must visit a **China Unicom** (preferred) or **China Mobile** hall with a physical passport.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Passport:** Physical original (copies/photos are often rejected).
- **Email:** Access to a non-blocked email (Outlook/iCloud) for digital receipts.
- **RMB 150:** Cash or Alipay balance for the initial deposit.

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. Choose Your Entry Method
- **Short Trip (Under 15 days):** Use Airalo, Yesim, or Nomad. No ID verification needed, but these often don't provide a "+86" number for app registrations. 
- **Digital Nomad / Long Stay:** You **must** have a "+86" number. Go to a China Unicom hall.

### 2. The Carrier Hall Protocol (Physical SIM)
- **Step 1:** Use Baidu/Amap to find a "Main Business Hall" (营业厅). Smaller retail kiosks often cannot handle foreign passports.
- **Step 2:** Request the **"Tourist Plan"** or **"Minimum Monthly Plan"** (Wǒ yào zuì dī tàocān). 
- **Step 3:** Perform the "Face Scan" (人脸识别). This is a legal requirement for real-name registration.
- **Verification:** Once the SIM is in, wait for a 10010/10086 SMS. Send `CXLL` to the carrier number to verify your data balance is active.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If the hall system rejects your passport:
1. **Try a Different Hall:** System sync issues are common. A hall 2 blocks away might have a newer scanner.
2. **Trip.com Physical SIM:** Order a physical SIM via Trip.com to your hotel address. They have a pre-verified KYC flow for tourists.
3. **Emergency Wi-Fi:** Hit any **Starbucks** or **Apple Store**. They have open Wi-Fi that usually bypasses the "SMS Login" requirement via a guest portal.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "WeChat Registration" Catch-22:** You need a phone number to get WeChat, but you often need WeChat to find a carrier hall. **Download offline maps** and the carrier locations *before* you lose your airport Wi-Fi.
- **Keep the Number:** If you plan on returning to China, keep at least 20 RMB in your balance. Most carriers will keep the number active for 3-6 months as long as there is a positive balance.
- **SIM Ejector Tool:** TechDad rule #1: Tape a SIM ejector tool (or a paperclip) to the back of your passport or inside your wallet. You will lose it otherwise.
