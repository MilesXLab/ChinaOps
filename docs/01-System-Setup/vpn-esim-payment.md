**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

### Problem
Foreign travelers cannot access foreign websites, apps, or complete payments due to regional restrictions.

### Root Cause
- Many global services (Google, WhatsApp, banking apps) are blocked in China.  
- Local payment systems (WeChat Pay, Alipay) require Chinese bank cards or phone numbers.

### Fix / Solution
- **VPN:** Install a reliable VPN before arrival. Test it with banking / messaging apps.  
- **eSIM / Local SIM:** Pre-order an eSIM or buy a local SIM with data. Major providers: China Mobile, China Unicom, China Telecom.  
- **Payment:** Use apps like Alipay or WeChat Pay with prepaid virtual cards (Travel SIM / Foreign credit card options).

### Miles’ Tips
- Set up accounts before arrival; do not rely on airport Wi-Fi for setup.  
- For families, link multiple devices to a single payment account.  

### Recommendations
- **VPN:** ExpressVPN, Surfshark (test reliability pre-trip).  
- **Prepaid eSIM:** Airalo or local Unicom SIM for foreigners.

### Local Hacks / Money-saving Tips
- Buy bottled water at 7-11 or local convenience stores, get change for small payments.  
- Set up small wallet for micro-transactions (metro, vending machines).
