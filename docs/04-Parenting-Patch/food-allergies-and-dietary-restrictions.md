# Food Allergies & Dietary Restrictions

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

---

## Problem
Parents with food allergies or dietary restrictions struggle to communicate restrictions to restaurants, identify safe ingredients, and find suitable food options. Language barriers and unfamiliar ingredients increase risk of allergic reactions.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

- **Language barrier:** Restaurant staff rarely speak English; food descriptions are vague.
- **Hidden ingredients:** Peanut/tree nut oils and shellfish are common in Chinese cooking but not always disclosed.
- **Cross-contamination:** Shared cooking surfaces and oils are standard in Chinese kitchens.
- **Unfamiliar ingredients:** Soy sauce, fish sauce, and oyster sauce contain allergens but aren't always obvious.
- **Labeling gaps:** Processed foods often lack clear allergen labels in English.

- **Laminate your allergy card** — Carry 5-10 copies; hand to every restaurant, even casual ones.
- **Speak to the chef** — For severe allergies, ask server to get chef's confirmation personally.
- **Shop at international supermarkets** — 30% premium is worth the safety peace of mind.
- **Screenshot safe dishes** — When you find a safe restaurant, take photos of the menu for reference.
- **Carry backup snacks** — Never rely on one restaurant for every meal; have safe snacks in hotel room.
- **Know the nearest hospital** — In case of reaction, have location, phone, and directions on phone.
- **Avoid sauce and oil** — Ask for dishes without sauce, cooked in own pan/wok, oil on the side.
- **Carry EpiPen/antihistamines** — Always accessible, not checked luggage; inform people around you where it is.
