# Safety, Health & Common Scams

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

### The Reality
China is statistically one of the safest countries for foreign travelers. Violent crime is extremely rare, and solo female travel is very safe even at night. However, petty scams and environmental health are things you must manage.

## 🚨 Common Scams to Avoid

### 1. The "Tea Ceremony / Art Student" Scam
- **Where:** Usually the Bund, People’s Square (Shanghai), or Wangfujing (Beijing).
- **How:** A friendly English-speaking student asks to "practice English" or invites you to see a "traditional art show/tea ceremony."
- **The Result:** You are hit with a massive bill (e.g., $500 for a pot of tea).
- **The Fix:** Just say **"No, thank you"** and keep walking.

### 2. The "Black Taxi"
- **How:** Drivers approaching you in airport/train station lobbies.
- **The Result:** They will charge you 5x the meter price or claim the destination is "too far."
- **The Fix:** Only use the official taxi rank outside the terminal or use the **Didi app**.

## 3. Separation & Lost Items

In massive crowds (especially during CNY or at the Bund), getting separated is a real risk.
- **The "Character Card" Solution:** Carry a physical card/note in your wallet with your **hotel name and full address in Chinese characters (Hanzi)**. If you are lost or your phone dies, you can show this to a taxi driver or police officer.
- **Digital Twin:** Keep photos of your **Passport, Visa, and Tickets** on your phone. If you lose your physical documents, having these photos speeds up the reporting process at the police station (Jǐngchájú).
- **Kid Protocol:** Put a similar contact card in your child’s pocket or backpack.

## 🏥 Environmental Health

### 1. Air Quality (AQI)
- **Problem:** Smog/Fog can occur in winter months (Nov-Feb).
- **Solution:** Download an app like **"AirVisual"** or **"AQI"**. If the index is over 150, wear a mask (KN95/N95) if you have respiratory issues.

### 2. Drinking Water
- **Warning:** **Never drink tap water.** It is not potable.
- **Solution:** Stick to bottled water (brands like **Nongfu Spring** are ~2 RMB). Hotels always provide bottled water for free. For hot water, use the electric kettle in your room—boiling tap water is the local standard for tea.

## TechDad's Tips

- **Valuables:** While theft is low, keep your passport in a secure pocket or the hotel safe. A photo of your passport on your phone is usually enough for daily ID checks.
- **The Police & Security:** Officers and security guards (indicated by "Police," "Security," or 警察 Jǐngchá) are extremely friendly and generally prioritize foreign visitors' requests. If you are lost or separated, just say **"Pǐngān"** (Safety/Help) or show your character card.
- **Language Help:** If you are stuck at a ticket machine or restaurant, look for **college-aged locals** (often wearing trendy gear or visible headphones). They almost always speak enough English to help you navigate a "system glitch" and are very friendly.

### Local Hacks & Health Tips
- **Stomach Comfort:** **"Boiled is best."** If you have a sensitive stomach, avoid raw vegetables/salads and ice in very cheap street stalls. Cooked street food (fried/boiled) is generally safer than pre-packaged cold sandwiches.
- **Pharmacy:** Local pharmacies (药店 yàodiàn) are everywhere. They sell Western medicines (Ibuprofen, etc.) and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Use a translation app to show them your specific symptoms.
