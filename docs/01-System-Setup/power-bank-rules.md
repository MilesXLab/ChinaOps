# Hardware Compatibility: Power Banks

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

### Problem
Travelers’ power banks get confiscated at airports or train stations.

### Root Cause
- Chinese transport security strictly enforces 3C certification and capacity limits.

### Fix / Solution
- Only bring 3C-certified power banks under 20,000mAh.  
- Keep labels clear; wear and tear may invalidate the certification.

### Miles’ Tips
- Carry a backup 10,000mAh bank fully charged as a “UPS” for phones.  
- Check train and metro station signage; some stations allow small batteries in hand luggage only.

### Recommendations
- Brands: Anker, Xiaomi.  
- Extra: Small 5,000mAh portable battery as emergency.

### Local Hacks / Money-saving Tips
- Use shared charging stations sparingly to avoid fees.  
- Fully charge devices in hotels or cafes offering free electricity.
