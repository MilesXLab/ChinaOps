# 🍽️ Food Allergies & Dietary Restrictions SOP

**TL;DR:** Always use a printed **Allergy Card** in Chinese. Order "Plain/Clear Stir-fry" (清炒) to minimize hidden oils. In 2026, **Jiahui** and **United Family** hospitals remain the primary nodes for anaphylaxis response.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Printed Allergy Card:** Laminated, postcard-size, containing your specific allergens in Chinese characters.
- **EpiPen/Antihistamine:** Must be in your carry-on, not checked-in.
- **Translation App:** Pleco or Google Translate (with offline camera data).

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The Pre-Order Audit
- **Step 1:** Hand your **Allergy Card** to the server *before* they take the order. 
- **Step 2:** Point to the allergens and say: **"Wǒ duì zhèxiē guòmǐn"** (I am allergic to these).
- **Step 3:** Order dishes labeled as **Qīngchǎo** (清炒 - clear stir-fry) or **Qīngzhēng** (清蒸 - steamed). These usually have the least hidden ingredients.
- **Verification:** Ask the server: **"Zhèlǐmiàn dōu méiyǒu zhèxiē ma?"** (Is none of this inside?). Look for their confirmation.

### 2. The Sauce & Oil Bypass
- **The Technical Fix:** In Chinese cooking, **Peanut Oil (花生油)** and **Oyster Sauce (蚝油)** are the primary "hidden" allergens.
- **Step:** Request the chef to use **Corn Oil (玉米油)** or **Sunflower Oil (葵花籽油)** if you have a nut allergy.
- **Action:** For severe allergies, request **"No Sauce" (不要酱 - bùyào jiàng)** as many pre-made sauces contain shellfish or peanut trace.

### 3. Verification Loop (Before the first bite)
- [ ] Inspect visually for "hidden" nuts or seeds.
- [ ] Check for "Seafood smell" if shellfish allergic.
- [ ] If in doubt, **Abort the meal.** High-trust nodes (Starbucks, Baker & Spice, Wagas) are safer than unknown street vendors.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If an allergic reaction starts:
1. **Mild (Hives/Itch):** Administer your own antihistamine immediately and monitor for 30 minutes.
2. **Severe (Swelling/Breathing):** Use your **EpiPen** and call **120**. Shout for help: **"Jiù mìng a! Guòmǐn le!"** (Save me! Allergy!).
3. **Medical Routing:** Go to the nearest **Grade A 3-Star Hospital (三甲医院)** or an international ER. Show them your Allergy Card to explain the trigger.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "Buddhist" Failover:** If you are Vegan or Vegetarian, look for **Buddhist Temple Restaurants**. They are the global standard for plant-based purity in China.
- **MSG is not an allergy:** While many people react to it, don't confuse it with life-threatening allergens in your card. Focus on the "Critical" ones.
- **International Hubs:** Malls like **Xintiandi Style** or **Jing'an Kerry Centre** have staff accustomed to dietary requests. When in doubt, eat at these locations.
