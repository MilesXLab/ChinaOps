## 🍼 1. Formula & Supplies

### Buying Formula
- **High-Trust Nodes:** Buy ONLY from **Hema (Freshippo)**, **Ole’**, **CitySuper**, or **Sam’s Club**. 
- **Delivery (30-60 min):** Use **Meituan** or **Ele.me**. 
  - **Search Terms:** `奶粉` (Infant Formula).
- **⚠️ Safety Check (Nestlé Recall Jan 2026):** 
  - **Context:** Global recall affecting brands like NAN, BEBA, and Lactogen due to cereulide toxin risk. 
  - **Fix:** Check the **Batch Number** on the base of the can on the Nestlé official website/app before use. If unclear, **DO NOT FEED.** Stick to brands like Aptamil or Friso.

### Diapers & Wipes
- **Search Terms:** `纸尿裤` (Diapers), `湿巾` (Wipes). 
- **Availability:** Supermarkets stock major brands like **Pampers** and **Huggies**. Avoid small street-side "mom and pop" shops for quality consistency.

## 🏥 2. Health & Medical (Finding a Doctor)

If your child has a fever, vomiting, or gets sick at night:
- **Pediatric Routing:** Go straight to the **International Departments** of major hospitals. 
- **Shanghai Recommended:**
  - **Jiahui International:** (Top choice for English support).
  - **United Family:** (Classic expat choice).
  - **Shanghai No.1 Maternity & Children's (VIP):** Highly professional, but busier.
- **Requirement:** Carry your child's **physical passport** for registration.

## 3. Transport & Gear (Stroller Protocols)

### High-Speed Rail (HSR)
- **First Class Hack:** Highly recommended. The legendary legroom allows you to keep a stroller unfolded for the baby to nap comfortably.
- **Second Class:** Aim for the **First Row** or **Last Row** of the carriage for extra floor space.
- **Hot Water Node:** Every carriage end has 100°C boiling water for bottle sterilization or mixing formula.

### Metro & Surface
- **Manual Gate:** Do not squeeze through the bifold gates. Go to the **Manual Lane / Green Channel** at the far end; staff will manually scan your ID and open the side gate for strollers.
- **Didi Car Seats:** Taxis and Didi cars in China **almost never** have car seats. Carry a portable harness or stick to the Metro/HSR for maximum safety.

## TechDad's Tips

- **Safe Havens (母婴室):** Malls like **Reel (Jing'an)**, **IAPM (Xuhui)**, and **IFC (Pudong)** have the cleanest Mother & Baby rooms in the city.
- **Lost Kid Protocol:** Print a card with your hotel Chinese address and your phone. Put it in your kid's pocket. If they wander off, local security or police will prioritize family reunion.
- **Pack a 3-Day Buffer:** Never land with only 2 diapers. Always have 72 hours of supplies in case your first delivery app setup fails.

### Pre-Trip Baby Checklist
- [ ] International Pediatric ER saved in maps.
- [ ] Nestlé batch checker bookmarked.
- [ ] Alipay / Meituan linked and verified.
- [ ] Child's Chinese-address card printed.
- [ ] Pediatric Paracetamol/Ibuprofen from home (Liquid form).
