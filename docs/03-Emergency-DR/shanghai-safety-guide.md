# Shanghai Safety & Scam Prevention

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

### Context
Shanghai is statistically one of the safest major cities in the world. Violent crime is extremely rare. However, petty scams and "social engineering" attacks targeting tourists do exist.

## 🛡️ 1. Real-World Safety Profile

- **Violence:** Near-zero. Solo female travelers and families can walk in almost any neighborhood at 2:00 AM without fear.
- **Surveillance:** High density of CCTV ("Skynet") means crime is solved very quickly. Police response time in core areas is usually < 5 minutes.
- **Lost & Found:** If you leave your phone in a Didi (taxi), the driver will almost always return it if you contact them via the App.

## 🚨 2. The "Social Engineering" Scams

### The Tea Ceremony / Art Student Scam
- **How it Works:** Friendly students approach you near The Bund or People's Square to "practice English" or see an "Art Show." They take you to a hidden room for a tea ceremony.
- **The Result:** You get a bill for 3,000+ RMB ($500).
- **The Fix:** Simply say **"No, thank you"** and keep walking. Real locals are usually too busy to approach random strangers for hours.

### The Black Taxi / Fake Didi
- **How it Works:** Drivers approach you inside the airport terminal or train stations.
- **The Result:** They charge 5x the meter price or claim the destination is "too far."
- **The Fix:** Only use the **Official Taxi Rank** outside or call a car through the **Didi App**.

## 🏥 3. Medical & Emergency SOP

- **International Routing:** If you have a medical emergency, do not go to a small clinic. Go straight to **International Departments** (e.g., **Jiahui Health**, **United Family**).
- **Police (110):** Officers are generally helpful. If you are in trouble, say **"Police"** or **"Pǐngān"** (Safety).
- **Character Card:** Always keep a physical card with your **hotel’s Chinese address** in your wallet. If your phone dies, this is your only way home.

## TechDad's Tips

- **Mobile is Life:** Keep your phone charged (100% + Power Bank). In Shanghai, your phone is your wallet, your map, and your translator. If it dies, you are effectively "offline" from society.
- **Language Hack:** If you are stuck or in trouble, look for **college-aged locals** (often wearing trendy gear/headphones). They almost always speak enough English to help you navigate a "system glitch."
- **Bag Placement:** While theft is low, in extremely crowded spots like the Metro at 6:00 PM, wear your backpack on your **front**.

### Local Hacks & Summary
- **Safe Haven:** If you feel uncomfortable or followed, step into any high-end Mall (IFC, IAPM, K11) or a 5-star Hotel Lobby. Security is 24/7.
- **Traffic Safety:** The biggest danger in Shanghai is **Traffic**. Delivery scooters often don't follow lights. Always look both ways, even on one-way streets.
