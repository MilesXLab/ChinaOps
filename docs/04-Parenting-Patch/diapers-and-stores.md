# 👶 Diapers & Baby Supplies SOP

**TL;DR:** Don't buy diapers at convenience stores (limited stock). Use **Hema/Freshippo** or **Meituan** for 30-min doorstep delivery. **ALDI** is the best node for "Western-spec" wipes and snacks.

**Prerequisites:**
- **App:** Meituan (美团) or Alipay.
- **Search Terms:** `纸尿裤` (Diapers), `湿巾` (Wipes), `奶粉` (Formula).
- **Redundancy:** 3-day buffer of supplies in your luggage.

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The "Emergency" Delivery Loop
- **Step 1:** Open **Meituan**. Click on `超市` (Supermarket).
- **Step 2:** Search for your brand (e.g., `Pampers`, `Merries`, `Moony`).
- **Step 3:** Enter your hotel name and room number (or meet in lobby).
- **Verification:** Rider arrives in 30-60 mins. Show your Alipay "Paid" screen if there's a security dispute.

### 2. Physical Sourcing: The "High-Trust" Nodes
- **Option A (Premium):** Go to **Ole'** or **CitySuper**. They carry the exact same brands as Europe/USA but at a 50%+ markup.
- **Option B (Reliable/Budget):** Go to **ALDI**. Their wipes and organic snacks are highly trusted by the expat community and follow EU standards.
- **Option C (Specialized):** **Kidswant (孩子王)**. Massive stores in malls like Global Harbor. Best for strollers, bottles, and specific medical-grade supplies.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If you are in a Tier 2/3 city with no "Premium" stores:
1. **The "Global-Self" Strategy:** Use **JD.com (京东)**. Choose products with the `京东自营` (Self-operated) tag. They offer next-morning delivery to almost any hotel in China.
2. **Local Pharmacy:** Large pharmacies often stock a small selection of premium diapers and formula if you're in a pinch.
3. **The "Mom Group" Hack:** If you have a specific emergency (e.g., ran out of specialized hypoallergenic formula), ask your hotel concierge to post on their "Local Community Group." People are incredibly helpful in these crisis moments.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "Tape" vs "Pant" Trap:** In China, **Pull-up Pants (拉拉裤)** are much more common for toddlers than tape diapers. Look for the "Pant" icon on the bag.
- **Diaper Sizes:** Chinese sizing (S, M, L, XL, XXL) is generally consistent with US/EU sizing, but "Asian Fit" brands (like Merries) tend to be smaller/shorter. If in doubt, size up.
- **Wipes Alert:** Many local wipes have high alcohol or fragrance content. Stick to **"Hand and Mouth" (手口湿巾)** wipes for babies with sensitive skin.
- **The "Hema" Buffet:** Hema stores (the ones with the Hippo logo) are the most efficient place to source fresh milk, organic fruit, and diapers simultaneously.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Relying on a single delivery app. 
- **Hotfix:** Always have both **Meituan** and **Ele.me** installed and linked to payment. If one app's rider network is down (common during heavy rain), the other might still be active.
