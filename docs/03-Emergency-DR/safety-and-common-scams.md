# 🚨 Safety & Common Scams (2026 Update)

**TL;DR:** China is extremely safe from physical crime, but "Social Engineering" scams target foreigners in tourist hubs. If a stranger is "too friendly" and suggests a specific location, it's a trap.

**Prerequisites:**
- **App:** Alipay/WeChat (to check prices of things).
- **Mental Model:** "Nothing is free in a tourist zone."

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The "Tea Ceremony / Art Student" Protocol
- **The Setup:** A group of students or a friendly couple approaches you at The Bund, People's Square, or East Nanjing Road. They want to "practice English" or show you a "local art gallery."
- **The Trap:** They take you to a private room for tea or art. You are presented with a bill for 5,000 - 20,000 RMB.
- **Verification:** If the invite comes within the first 5 minutes of meeting a stranger in a high-traffic zone, **it is a scam.**
- **Action:** Politely say "No, thank you" and keep walking.

### 2. The "Broken Meter" Taxi Protocol
- **The Setup:** A driver at the airport or station says "Meter broken, flat price 400 RMB."
- **Verification:** Check the **DiDi** app for the real price. It's usually 60-100 RMB.
- **Action:** Only use the **Official Taxi Queue**. If a driver refuses the meter, get out immediately and take a photo of their ID card on the dashboard.

### 3. The "QR Code Overlay" Hack
- **The Setup:** Scammers put their own QR code sticker over a legitimate merchant's code.
- **Verification:** In Alipay/WeChat, check the **recipient's name** before hitting "Confirm." It should match the shop name or the staff's uniform.
- **Action:** If the name is a random individual (e.g., "*Mr. Zhang"), double-check with the staff.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If you have already been scammed:
1. **Call 110 immediately:** Even if you think "I was stupid," the police take scamming of foreigners very seriously in 2026.
2. **Bank Dispute:** If you paid via credit card, call your bank to freeze the transaction. If via Alipay, use the **"Report Transaction"** button in the payment record.
3. **The "Scene" Strategy:** If you are being pressured to pay a high bill in a shop, do not go to a back room. Stay in the public area and loudly say **"Call the Police" (Bào jǐng)**. Scammers hate public attention.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **Drinking Water:** Do not drink tap water. Even locals boil it. Buy bottled water (C'estbon, Nongfu Spring) or use the hotel's complimentary bottles.
- **Emergency Phrases:** 
  - "I'm calling the police": *Wǒ yào bào jǐng le.*
  - "I don't have money": *Wǒ méi yǒu qián.*
- **Pickpockets:** Rare, but stay alert in crowded markets like Yuyuan Garden. Keep your phone in your front pocket.
