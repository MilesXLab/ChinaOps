# Hospital & Medical Care for Foreigners

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

---

## Problem
Seeking medical care in China can be overwhelming due to language barriers, complex registration systems, and different standards of care.

---

## Root Cause
- **Public Hospitals:** Extremely crowded, require registration via WeChat/Alipay mini-programs which can be difficult for foreigners, and often have very limited English support.
- **Registration:** You **must** have your original passport to register at any medical facility.

---

## Where to Go (Shanghai Recommendations)

### 1. International Standard Hospitals (Expats' Choice)
These are Western-style hospitals with English-speaking doctors, international insurance direct billing, and an appointment system.
- **Jiahui International Hospital (嘉会国际医院):** (Top Recommendation) Extremely modern, high-standard, and very popular with families. Excellent pediatrics.
- **United Family Healthcare (和睦家):** The most established international hospital chain. High quality but also the most expensive.
- **ParkwayPathology/ParkwayHealth:** Reliable clinics for minor issues and consultations.

### 2. Public Hospitals with VIP/International Wings
Cheaper than the "pure" international hospitals but higher standard than the general public wings.
- **Ruijin Hospital (瑞金医院) - VIP Wing**
- **Huashan Hospital (华山医院) - Worldwide Medical Center**

## Miles' Tips

- **🏥 Call Ahead** — Even for urgent care, call the international hospital's 24/7 hotline. They can tell you the current wait time and prepare for your arrival.
- **Direct Billing** — If you have international travel insurance (e.g., Allianz, Cigna), Jiahui and United Family can often bill them directly. **Bring your insurance card and passport.**
- **SmartShanghai Listings** — Use the **SmartShanghai app** to find the most up-to-date addresses and phone numbers for emergency rooms.
- **Bring Your Own Maintenance Meds** — While pharmacies are everywhere, finding specific Western brands of maintenance medication (e.g., for asthma or ADHD) can be very difficult and require a local prescription.

### Local Hacks / Money-saving Tips
- **Telemedicine:** Some international clinics offer a "video consult" for ~150-300 RMB. If it's just a minor rash or a prescription refill, this is much cheaper than an in-person visit.
- **Convenience Medicine:** ALDI and local pharmacies (like LBX) carry basic Ibuprofen and Paracetamol, but always check the Pinyin: **yìbùqiūfēn** (Ibuprofen) and **duìyǐxi酰ànjiǎonà** (Paracetamol/Acetaminophen).
