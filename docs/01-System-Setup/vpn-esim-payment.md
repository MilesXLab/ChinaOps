# 🌐 VPN, eSIM & Payment Setup

**TL;DR:** Install **Trip.com eSIM** (bypass) or **Yesim** offshore. First choice for payment: **Alipay/WeChat Pay**. If blocked, activate **Alipay Tour Card** or use **Cash Backup**.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Unlocked Phone:** Verify with your home carrier before departure.
- **International Card:** Visa/Mastercard (debit or credit).
- **KYC Time:** Allow 24-48 hours for account verification before landing.

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. Connectivity Layer: Native Bypass
- **Step:** Purchase a **Trip.com eSIM** or **Yesim**. In 2026, these route traffic through HK/Macao, natively bypassing the firewall.
- **Verification:** Turn off Wi-Fi, enable eSIM. Open `google.com`. If it loads, you are "off-wall" without needing a VPN.
- **Fallback:** If eSIM signal stalls, switch to **LetsVPN** or **LightningX**. Recent Jan 2026 reports suggest **ShadowFly** is also highly resilient against the latest firewall probes.

### 2. Payment Layer: System Redundancy
- **Step A:** Bind your card to **Alipay** and complete the KYC. 
- **The "Wise" Move:** Link a **Wise** or **Revolut** card for the best exchange rates.
- **Step B:** Repeat for **WeChat Pay**.
- **Verification:** Try a small purchase (e.g., 1 RMB mobile top-up) within the app before you leave.

## 🚨 Final Failover (Plan B)

### If Alipay/WeChat rejects the transaction (Security Risk):
1. **Alipay Tour Card:** Search "Tour Card" in Alipay. This is a pre-paid balance for foreigners.
2. **Physical Cash:** Go to a **Bank of China (BOC) ATM** and withdraw 500-1000 RMB.
3. **Critical Alert:** New regulations effective **Feb 1, 2026** strictly mandate that all merchants **must accept cash**. If they claim "no change," stay calm—they are legally required to find a solution.
4. **FacePay Limitation:** Do not attempt to set up or use **Face Verification (FacePay)** in stores. As of Jan 2026, this system is primarily restricted to Chinese ID holders. Stick to QR code scanning.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips
- **NFC Tap-to-Pay:** In 2026, many Metro systems in Tier-1 cities now support **International NFC** (Visa/Mastercard tap). Keep your physical card handy for the gate.
- **The "Check-in" Wi-Fi:** Many hotel portals require a SMS code. If your roaming isn't working, you can't get the code. **Action:** Use your eSIM data to log into the portal.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Relying on a single payment app.
- **Hotfix:** WeChat Pay waives the 3% fee for transactions under 200 RMB until mid-2026. Use WeChat for small coffee/snacks and Alipay for larger bookings.
