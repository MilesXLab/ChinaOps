# 💊 Pharmacy & OTC Medication SOP

**TL;DR:** Use **Chemical/Generic names** (e.g., Ibuprofen), not brand names (Advil). Use **Meituan** for 30-min delivery to your hotel. Antibiotics require a physical hospital prescription.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Translation App:** Pleco or Google Translate (with chemical names).
- **Physical ID:** Passport (sometimes required for specific OTC meds).
- **Payment:** Alipay/WeChat balance.

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The Pinyin Translation (The Protocol)
- **Step 1:** Translate the **active ingredient**. 
- **Step 2:** Match with the common local names:
  | Western Need | Chinese Name | Pinyin |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **Ibuprofen (Advil)** | 布洛芬 | Bùluòfēn |
  | **Acetaminophen (Tylenol)** | 对乙酰氨基酚 | Duìyǐxi酰ànjiǎonà |
  | **Loperamide (Imodium)** | 洛哌丁胺 | Luòpàidīng'àn |
  | **Cetirizine (Zyrtec)** | 西替利嗪 | Xitìlìqín |
- **Verification:** Confirm the dosage (mg) on the box matches your home standard.

### 2. Sourcing: The "App-First" Strategy
- **Step 1:** Open **Meituan (美团)** or **Ele.me (饿了么)**. Click `看病买药` (Medical/Pharmacy).
- **Step 2:** Search for the generic name. Select a store with a `24H` icon for nighttime delivery.
- **Verification:** A rider will deliver the meds to your hotel lobby within 30-60 minutes.

### 3. Physical Pharmacy Protocol
- **Step 1:** Find a chain pharmacy like **LBX (老百姓)** or **Daishengtang (大生堂)**.
- **Step 2:** Show the pharmacist the Pinyin name or the chemical formula.
- **Step 3:** Perform the "Face/ID scan" if prompted (some OTC fever meds require registration).
- **Verification:** Ensure the box has a **"OTC"** (Green or Red) label. Green is slightly safer/milder.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If the pharmacy rejects you or the med is out of stock:
1. **The "Watsons" Node:** Go to a large **Watsons (屈臣氏)**. They carry international-branded versions of basic supplies (bandages, cough drops, mild pain relievers) and usually have staff accustomed to foreigners.
2. **Telemedicine:** Use the **Alibaba Health (阿里健康)** mini-program for a 5-minute video consultation to get an electronic prescription for restricted meds.
3. **Emergency Room:** If you have a severe infection and need antibiotics, do not waste time at pharmacies. Only a **Hospital** can dispense them.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "Antibiotic" Trap:** Unlike some countries, you cannot "negotiate" for antibiotics at a Chinese pharmacy. The system is strictly integrated with hospital prescriptions.
- **Check the Date:** Chinese expiration dates are often written as **Production Date + Shelf Life Months**. (e.g., 2025-01-01 + 24 months). Don't mistake the production date for the expiration date.
- **Safe Brands:** Stick to **Fenbid (芬必得)** for Ibuprofen—it's the gold standard in China.
- **Chinese Medicine (TCM):** Pharmacists will often try to upsell you **TCM (中药)**. If you want Western medicine, specify **"Xī yào"** (Western medicine).

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Relying on the pharmacist for dosing. 
- **Hotfix:** Always cross-reference the dosage on the box with your home country's medical website (like NHS or WebMD) before swallowing.
