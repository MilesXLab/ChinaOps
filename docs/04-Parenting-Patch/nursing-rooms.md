# 🤱 Nursing & Baby Care Rooms SOP

**TL;DR:** Search for `母婴室` (Mǔ yīng shì) in map apps. High-end Malls (IFC, IAPM, Reel) are the "Tier-1" nodes for nursing. Public street toilets are "Last Resort" only.

**Prerequisites:**
- **App:** Amap (高德地图) or Baidu Maps.
- **Search Term:** `母婴室`.
- **Gear:** Portable changing mat (for "Tier-3" locations).

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The High-Availability Search
- **Step 1:** Open your map app.
- **Step 2:** Search for `母婴室` in your current district.
- **Step 3:** Prioritize search results inside **Shopping Malls (购物中心)** over public parks or metro stations.
- **Verification:** Follow the map to the mall's restroom area. The nursing room is usually a separate door nearby with a "Bottle/Baby" icon.

### 2. The Mall Protocol (Tier-1 Node)
- **Step 1:** Look for a "Mother & Baby" room (usually located on floors with kids' clothing or toys).
- **Step 2:** Enter. Most in SH are touch-free; some require you to press a "door open" button.
- **Verification:** Typical facilities include:
  - Private nursing cubicles with chairs.
  - Padded changing tables.
  - Hot water dispenser (40°C for formula).
  - Baby wipes and diaper disposal bins.

### 3. The Public Transit Node (Tier-2)
- **Step 1:** Major Metro transfer stations (like People's Square or Xujiahui) now have nursing rooms.
- **Step 2:** Ask the **Manned Service Desk** (the booth at the ticket gate) for the location. They are often kept locked and require staff to open them.
- **Verification:** If the room is dirty or lacks a table, use the **Stroller-fold hack** (change the baby in the unfolded stroller if space allows).

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If no nursing room is available and you have an "Emergency":
1. **The "Luxury Lobby" Strategy:** Walk into a **5-star Hotel** (e.g., Marriott, Hyatt). Ask the front desk: **"Qǐngwèn mǔyīngshì zài nǎlǐ?"** (Where is the nursing room?). Even if they don't have a dedicated room, they will often offer a private lounge or auxiliary room.
2. **The "Cafe Booth" Failover:** Use a corner booth in a large **Starbucks** or **FamilyMart**. Use your jacket or a portable mat to create a temporary change station.
3. **Airport Gate Hubs:** Airports (PVG/SHA) have nursing rooms near almost every group of gates. They are your most reliable nodes before a 10-hour flight.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "IFC" Gold Standard:** The nursing room in the **IFC Mall (Pudong)** is essentially a luxury hotel suite for babies. Even includes a microwave for heating baby food.
- **Dianping Heatmap:** Use the **Dianping** app to read reviews of nursing rooms. Search for the mall name + `母婴室` to see photos before you walk 1km to get there.
- **Public Breastfeeding:** It is generally acceptable and quiet in China. Using a nursing cover is common, but you will not be harassed or asked to leave. 
- **The "Hot Water" Node:** Almost all nursing rooms have a 24/7 hot water dispenser. Test the temperature! Some are 100°C (boiling), which is dangerous for skin or direct feeding.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Assuming all "Baby Care" icons on the map actually have a working door/sink.
- **Hotfix:** Always have a backup mall in mind within 500m. Shanghai malls are so dense that if one's nursing room is "Under Repair," the next one is usually across the street.
