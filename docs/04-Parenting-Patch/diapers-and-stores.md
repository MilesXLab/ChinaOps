# Diapers & Baby Supplies in Shanghai

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

## Problem
Foreign parents often worry about finding familiar diaper brands or safe, high-quality baby supplies in local stores.

---

## Root Cause
- Local corner stores (convenience stores) have very limited selection.
- Specialized "Mother & Baby" stores (like Kidswant) are great but often located in suburban malls.

## Where to Buy (The Shanghai Map)

### 1. High-End Supermarkets (Most Familiar Brands)
These stores carry imported brands (Pampers, Merries, Moony, organic puffs, and Western formula).
- **Ole' Supermarket:** Found in major malls (e.g., Jing'an Kerry Centre).
- **City'Super:** Located in premium locations like IAPM or IFC.
- **ALDI:** (High Recommendation) Very popular in Shanghai now. They carry clean, high-quality, and affordable staples, including wipes and snacks that feel "Western" in quality.

### 2. Large Supermarkets (Bulky Items)
- **Carrefour / Walmart:** Best for buying large boxes of diapers or wipes at lower prices.
- **Sam's Club / Costco:** If you have a membership (or a friend with one), these are the gold standard for bulk buying.

### 3. Specialized Stores
- **Toys "R" Us:** Good for bottles, pacifiers, and reliable toys.
- **Mothercare / Kidswant:** Specialized in everything from strollers to maternity clothes.

## Miles' Tips

- **Pack a 3-day buffer** — Don't arrive expecting to find your specific brand at 11 PM. Bring enough supplies to last until you can get to one of the supermarkets above.
- **Use Meituan/Ele.me (The "Life Saver")** — If you run out of diapers at your hotel, use the Meituan app. You can search for "Pampers" (帮宝适) or "Diapers" (纸尿裤), and a rider will deliver them to your hotel lobby within 30-40 minutes.
- **Don't overpack formula** — If your child uses global brands like Aptamil, Nestlé Nan, or Wyeth, they are widely available in Shanghai’s Tier 1 supermarkets.

### Local Hacks / Money-saving Tips
- **WeChat Mini-Programs:** Many brands have their own "shops" inside WeChat. If you are staying for more than a week, ordering via WeChat is often 20% cheaper than in-store.
- **Quality Check:** Avoid buying baby formula from small, unbranded street shops. Stick to the major chains mentioned above for safety.
