# ChinaOps - Technical Runbook for Travelers & Parents

**Real-world solutions from a parent living in Shanghai**

> **ChinaOps is not a travel guide.**
> It’s a technical runbook for operating daily life in China — 
> when payment fails, apps break, kids cry, or plans collapse.

---

> ChinaOps is currently in v1.
>
> This version is intentionally free, minimal, and text-first.
> The goal is to help travelers and parents solve real-world problems in China — not to sell recommendations.
>
> **Terms of Use:** This project is free and open-source for personal use only. **Commercial use is strictly prohibited.** Any commercial application must contact the author for permission.  
> **使用条款：** 本项目免费开源，仅限个人使用。**严禁任何形式的商业用途**，任何商业使用必须联系作者授权。

> Real feedback and real issues will shape v2.

### ⚠️ What ChinaOps v1 does NOT cover (yet):
- ❌ **Sightseeing itineraries** (We don't tell you where to go)
- ❌ **Restaurant rankings** (We don't tell you what to eat)
- ❌ **Influencer-style recommendations** (We don't do "aesthetic" spots)

This project focuses on **what to do when things go wrong**.

---

## Inside Every Guide

Each guide (SOP) includes:
- **Problem** – What you're struggling with
- **Step-by-Step Solution** – Exact instructions
- **TechDad's Tips** – Insider advice from a local
- **Trusted Brands/Apps** – Recommendations we've verified
- **Verified Contacts** – Phone numbers, addresses

## Why ChinaOps is Different

| Feature | ChinaOps | Other Guides |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Based on Real Experience** | ✅ Tested by travelers actually in China | ❌ Often theoretical |
| **Safety-First** | ✅ Emergency procedures included | ❌ Often missing |
| **No Sponsorships** | ✅ Zero ads, zero promoted brands | ❌ Often monetized |
| **Community Driven** | ✅ Contributions welcome & credited | ❌ Closed to public |

## Why Open Source? 🔍

ChinaOps is open-source because we believe navigating a country shouldn't be a "black box" operation.

- **Transparency & Verifiability**: Every step in our SOPs is open for inspection. There are no hidden affiliate links, no paid rankings, and no secondary agendas. What you see is exactly what we use.
- **Community-Powered "Hot-patches"**: Travel policies and app interfaces in China change at a rapid-fire pace. Open source allows the community to report outdated info and submit corrections in real-time, ensuring the runbook remains accurate for everyone.
- **Access over Anxiety**: We don't believe in "pay-walling" survival tips or manufacturing anxiety to sell a "secret" guide. Essential information—how to find a hospital, how to pay for a taxi, or how to check milk safety—should be free and accessible to every traveler and parent.

## Feedback: Something broke in China? 🚨

Tell me what happened. We value **problem reports** over likes.

If something breaks, feels confusing, or is outdated:
1. **[Open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/MilesXLab/ChinaOps/issues)** (Recommended)
2. Describe the "System Failure" (What was the error? What app failed?)
3. Share the "Hotfix" if you found one.

Real problems > perfect documentation.
