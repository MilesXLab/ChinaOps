## 📋 Content Standards

### What Makes a Good Contribution

**❌ Avoid:**
- Unverified opinions ("I think it might work")
- Generic travel advice (use Google for that)
- Outdated information (more than 6 months old)
- Sponsored recommendations or promotions
- Information not applicable to China
- Very short submissions (less than 300 words for new SOPs)

**✅ Aim for:**
- Personal experience ("I tried this and it worked")
- Specific examples ("The hospital at 123 Main St...")
- Real contact info (verified phone numbers, hours)
- Current as of [recent date]
- Multiple solution paths
- Safety warnings and emergency procedures
- Real costs and time estimates

### Writing Style

- **Audience:** Foreign travelers/parents, English-speaking
- **Tone:** Helpful, practical, not condescending
- **Detail level:** Step-by-step instructions with what to expect
- **Language:** English primary, Chinese terms in brackets with pinyin
- **Format:** Follow the SOP template structure

**Example of good writing:**
```
1. Go to the pharmacy (ask hotel staff for "yao fang" 药房)
2. Tell staff: "我需要儿童感冒药" (I need children's cold medicine)
   - Expected response: Staff will ask child's age/weight
3. Prices typically 20-50 RMB for OTC medications
4. If staff says "需要处方" (need prescription), go to a hospital clinic instead
```

**Example of weak writing:**
```
- Get medicine from pharmacy
- Ask pharmacist for help
- Follow instructions
```

## 🎓 Examples of Great Contributions

### Example 1: New SOP

**Topic:** "Pharmacy Language Barrier"

**Sections included:**
1. Real problem encountered
2. Why pharmacists don't speak English
3. Step-by-step solution (with phrases)
4. Common medications + Chinese names
5. Multiple ways to communicate
6. Cost breakdown

**Result:** 400+ lines, super helpful, filed!

### Example 2: Correction

**Original:** "Hospital visit costs around 200-300 RMB"

**Correction:** "Initial visit 100-150 RMB, but tests/procedures add 200-500 RMB. International clinics charge 300-500 RMB for initial visit."

**Evidence:** "Visited 3 hospitals in Shanghai, Jan 2026"

**Result:** Updated for accuracy!

### Example 3: Local Hack

**New info:** "You can rent power banks at 7-11 for 8 RMB/hour instead of buying one"

**Evidence:** "Tested at multiple 7-11 locations across Shanghai, Jan 2026"

**Result:** Added to Power Bank Rules SOP!
