# Pharmacy & Over-the-Counter Medications

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

---

## Problem
Foreign travelers struggle to find appropriate medications, navigate pharmacy systems, and communicate symptoms in Chinese. Many familiar brands are unavailable.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

- **Language barrier:** Pharmacists speak limited English; Chinese names differ from Western brands.
- **Brand mismatch:** Common medications (ibuprofen, acetaminophen) have different product names.
- **Regulation differences:** Some OTC drugs in Western countries require prescription in China.
- **Quality concerns:** Unfamiliar brands create doubts about product efficacy and safety.

---

## Solution (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Identify Your Needs BEFORE Arriving
- **Create a medication list** in both English and Chinese (use Google Translate or WeChat translator).
- Bring **copies of prescriptions** for chronic medications (diabetes, asthma, heart conditions).
- Screenshot the chemical name (not brand name) of medications you use.

### Step 2: Using Chinese Pharmacies (药房 yào fáng)

**Common Pharmacy Chains:**
| Chain | Coverage | English Support | Price |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **China National Pharmaceutical** | Nationwide | Basic | Regulated |
| **Watsons** | Major cities | Good | Slightly higher |
| **A.S. Watson (Guardian)** | Major cities | Excellent | Premium |
| **Local independent pharmacies** | Everywhere | Limited | Competitive |

### Step 3: Communicating at the Pharmacy

**Use this approach:**
1. **Show, don't tell** — Point to the symptom description on your phone or use translator app.
2. **Use chemical names** — "Ibuprofen" (布洛芬 bù luó fèn) works better than brand names.
3. **Ask for recommendations** — "What do you recommend for [symptom]?" (推荐一个 tuī jiàn)
4. **Ask for non-prescription option first** — Many pharmacists recommend OTC alternatives.

**Useful Phrases (use translator app if needed):**
- "I have a headache" (我头疼) wǒ tóu téng
- "I have a stomachache" (我肚子疼) wǒ dùzi téng
- "I have a fever" (我发烧) wǒ fā shāo
- "Do I need a prescription?" (需要处方吗？) xū yào chǔ fāng ma?
- "Do you have the non-prescription version?" (有不需要处方的版本吗？) yǒu búxū yào chǔ fāng de bǎn běn ma?

## Miles' Tips

- **Bring your own common medications** from home (pain relievers, allergy meds, anti-diarrhea) — ensures familiarity and saves time.
- **Take photos of medication instructions** at home before traveling — reference materials for equivalents.
- **Ask pharmacist to write instructions** on the bag — some do, many don't, so verify dosage.
- **For serious conditions,** go directly to hospital rather than self-medicating. Pharmacists may misdiagnose.
- **Payment:** Most pharmacies accept Alipay/WeChat Pay; large chains accept credit cards.
- **For children's medications,** specify age and weight — dosing is different than adults.

## Local Hacks & Money-Saving Tips

**Cost Optimization:**
- OTC medications from pharmacies are 30-50% cheaper than hospitals.
- Buy from generic brands rather than premium brands — same active ingredient.
- Use **JD.com app** for discounts on common OTC meds (5-15% off).
- Pharmacies near hospitals are slightly more expensive; go to neighborhood chains instead.

**Quality Assurance:**
- Check **expiration dates** carefully (production date is printed, not always obvious).
- Request **medicines with clearest instructions** — some products have vague dosing.
- Take photos of the packaging for future reference.

**Efficiency:**
- Go to larger chains during off-peak hours (2-4pm) — shorter waits, more English support.
- Use WeChat pharmacy apps for pre-order (saves 10-15 minutes).
