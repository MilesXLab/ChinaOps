# 🛡️ Shanghai Physical Safety & Urban Defense

**TL;DR:** Shanghai is statistically one of the safest cities on earth. The primary physical risk is **Traffic (Scooters)**. Violent crime is near-zero. Phone battery at 0% is your biggest "threat."

**Prerequisites:**
- **Mental Model:** "Yield to everything that moves."
- **Equipment:** Power Bank (Your lifeline).
- **Physical ID:** Passport (Technical requirement).

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The Traffic Avoidance Protocol
- **Step 1:** When crossing the street, look for **Electric Scooters (Waimai)**. They are silent and often ride against traffic or on sidewalks.
- **Step 2:** Never assume a Green Light means it's safe to walk without looking. Rights-on-red are legal for cars.
- **Verification:** Establish eye contact with drivers/riders before stepping in front of them.

### 2. The Night-time Movement Logic
- **Step 1:** Walk anywhere in the city at any time (2 AM, 4 AM). Avoid poorly lit construction zones simply to prevent trips/falls.
- **Step 2:** If you feel uneasy, head toward the nearest **24H Convenience Store** (FamilyMart, Lawson, 7-11). These are "safe nodes" with CCTV and staff.
- **Verification:** Check the density of people; "empty" streets in central SH are rare and usually just high-end residential.

### 3. The "Lost in System" Recovery
- **Step 1:** If your phone dies and you are lost, find a **5-star Hotel**. Walk into the lobby.
- **Step 2:** Show the concierge your hotel's name (or your printed card).
- **Verification:** They will either call a taxi or help you charge your phone at a hub.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If you are in a crowded emergency (Escalator failure, crowd crush):
1. **The "Front-Pack" Strategy:** Move your backpack to your chest. This creates a breathing space and prevents theft in high-density crowds.
2. **Police Interaction:** If you see a police officer, they are usually in dark blue or black uniforms with a "POLICE" patch. Shout **"Pǐng'ān"** (Safety/Help).
3. **Emergency Exit:** All major malls (IFC, IAPM) and Metro stations have clearly marked green exit signs. Look for them the moment you enter a sub-level.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **The "Skynet" Reality:** CCTV is everywhere. This is why you can leave a laptop on a cafe table and find it there 20 minutes later. However, don't test your luck—keep your gear close.
- **Female Solo Travel:** Shanghai is the "Gold Standard" for solo female safety. No special precautions are needed beyond standard urban common sense.
- **Water Safety:** Only drink bottled or boiled water. Tap water is for washing, not drinking.
- **The "Scooter" Warning:** Delivery riders are on a high-speed timer. They will not stop for you. You must stop for them.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Relying on your phone for your destination address. 
- **Hotfix:** Keep a physical business card of your hotel in your wallet at all times.
