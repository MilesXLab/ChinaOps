# 🥛 Milk & Formula Safety Protocol

**TL;DR:** Only buy formula from **High-Trust Nodes** (Hema, Sam's Club). Use WeChat to scan for anti-counterfeit, but **manually input** batch numbers for the **Jan 2026 Nestlé Recall** to avoid scanning errors.

**Prerequisites:**
- **App:** WeChat/Alipay (Counterfeit check) + Web Browser (Recall check).
- **Physical Package:** Keep the original can; locate the batch number on the base.
- **72h Buffer:** Always have 3 days of formula on hand in case a batch is flagged.

## 📋 The Runbook

### 1. The Purchase Audit (Node Selection)
- **Step 1:** Avoid small street-side "Mom & Pop" shops. Go to a **Hema (Freshippo)**, **Ole'**, or **CitySuper**.
- **Step 2:** Check the "Best Before" date. In China, this is usually on the bottom of the can.
- **Verification:** Ensure the plastic seal is unbroken and the "Anti-Counterfeit" sticker is present.

### 2. General Verification (Anti-Counterfeit)
- **Step 1:** For most brands (Aptamil, Friso), open WeChat and scan the QR code under the lid.
- **Verification:** The system confirms manufacturing dates and "First-time Scan" status. This is for **authenticity**, not recall status.

### 3. Nestlé Recall Check (Independent Web-Only Tool)
- **Problem:** The **Jan 2026 Nestlé Global Recall** is a critical safety incident. Standard brand-led apps (WeChat/Alipay) may lag in updating global recall batches or lack precise manual entry for all regions.
- **Action:** Open your mobile browser and access the [**Nestlé Recall Checker (Web-Only)**](https://milesxlab.github.io/nestle-recall-checker/).
- **Protocol:** **Manual Batch Entry Only.** 
  - Do not attempt to find a WeChat mini-program for this specific tool; it is developed as a standalone web app to ensure 100% manual accuracy and global access.
  - Locate the batch number at the base of the can and type it in.
- **Verification:** The tool provides a direct safety status. This is a primary safety node for Jan 2026 travelers.

## 🚨 Fallback (Plan B)

### If your formula is recalled or out of stock:
1. **The "International Wing" Failover:** Head to **Jiahui International** or **United Family Hospital**. Their pharmacies often stock small emergency amounts of medical-grade/hypoallergenic formula.
2. **Global Delivery:** Use **JD.com (Worldwide)**. Choose "Self-operated" (京东自营) for 24-hour delivery of imported stock.
3. **Emergency Substitute:** If in a Tier-1 city, **ALDI** stocks reliable house-brand milk/toddler formula that is safety-vetted for the German market.

## 💡 TechDad's Tips

- **Water Temperature:** Most formula requires 40-50°C. Do not use the high-speed rail's 100°C water directly! Mix it with bottled water (Nongfu Spring) to hit the target temp.
- **The "Import" Tax:** Imported formula (Aptamil/HiPP) is 50-80% more expensive in China than in Europe. Don't be shocked by 350 RMB price tags.
- **Safe Water:** Use **distilled water** or **baby-specific bottled water** (e.g., Nongfu Spring with the baby icon) for mixing. Tap water in China, even if boiled, has high mineral content that can hurt a baby's kidneys.

## 🚩 Strategic Gap: The "SPOF" Warning
**Single Point of Failure:** Relying on one specific brand of formula.
- **Hotfix:** Before leaving your home country, test if your baby can tolerate a common global brand (like Aptamil) as a backup.
