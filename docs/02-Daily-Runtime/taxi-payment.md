# Taxi & Mobile Payment

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

### 🚨 Failover Procedure (If Didi/Taxi Fails)
1.  **Didi-in-Alipay:** If the standalone Didi app won't accept your login, open **Alipay -> Search "Didi"**. The mini-program uses your Alipay identity and works almost 100% of the time.
2.  **The Metro Failover:** In Shanghai, the Metro is faster than taxis during 8-10 AM and 5-7 PM. If a Didi says "30 mins wait," head to the nearest station. Use Alipay "Transport" QR to pay.
3.  **Official Taxi Stands:** At airports (PVG/SHA), **ONLY** use the official taxi queue outside. Ignore everyone inside who says "Taxi?". The official ones use meters and are regulated.

### Problem
Tourists struggle to hail taxis or pay cashless in China.

### Root Cause
- Many taxis prefer mobile apps (Didi) over cash.  
- Apps often require local phone numbers.

### Fix / Solution
- Install Didi app with foreign-friendly registration.  
- Carry small cash as backup.---

## TechDad's Tips (Street Smarts)

- **The Lost Phone Protocol:** If you lose your phone in a taxi, you are in a "System Outage" state. **The only way to find it is the Paper Receipt (Fa-piao).** Always ask: "Wǒ yào fàpiào." It has the car ID and phone number.
- **Messaging Drivers:** Didi drivers will often call you to confirm your exact location. If you can't speak Chinese, use the **In-app Chat**. It has a built-in translator—use it to say "Standing by the Starbucks" (zài xīngbākè ménkǒu).
- **Ask hotels for taxi assistance.**  
- **Check car plate & driver ID before entering.**
- **Parent Warning:** Standard taxis and Didi cars **do not provide baby seats**. If you need one, you must bring your own portable seat or book a specific "Premium/Luxury" car via the app and message the driver in advance (though availability is still very limited).

### Recommendations
- Apps: Didi, Meituan Taxi  
- Keep QR codes for app payments ready.

### Local Hacks / Money-saving Tips
- Combine rides (family / group) to split fare.  
- Use airport/hotel shared shuttles for cheaper options.
