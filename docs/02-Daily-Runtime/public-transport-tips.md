# Public Transport: Metro, Bikes & Ferries

## Problem
Ticket machines at Metro stations are often crowded, confusing for non-Chinese speakers, or don't accept foreign cards.

---

## Metro (The Urban Backbone)

### How to Pay
- **Alipay/WeChat QR:** (Top Choice) Search for "Transport" or "Metro" inside the apps. It generates a QR code you scan at the gate. No physical tickets needed.
- **Apple Wallet:** You can add a virtual **Shanghai Public Transport Card** directly to your iPhone. It supports "Express Mode" (tap without waking the phone).

### High-Efficiency Hacks
- **Avoid Peak Hours:** Do not use the Metro between **8:00 AM – 9:00 AM** and **5:30 PM – 7:00 PM** if you have luggage or a stroller. It is physically impossible to move comfortably.
- **Car Choice:** Look at the platform floor; signs indicate where the **Elevator-accessible** cars stop. This is vital for strollers.

## Shared Bikes (The "Last Mile" Solution)

For any trip between **1km – 3km**, shared bikes are faster and cheaper than taxis.
- **How to Use:** Use **Alipay (HelloBike)** or **Meituan**. Scan the QR code on the back of the bike.
- **Cost Optimization:** If you are staying for more than 3 days, buy a **"7-Day Pass"** in the app (usually < 10 RMB). It gives you unlimited 30-minute rides, essentially making short-distance travel free.

## Public Ferries (Hidden Gem)

Skip the expensive "Sightseeing Cruises" on the Bund. 
- **The Route:** Use the public ferry to cross the Huangpu River between The Bund and Lujiazui towers.
- **Cost:** **2 RMB**.
- **Payment:** Just tap your virtual Metro card or scan your Alipay transport QR.
- **The View:** You get the exact same skyline panorama for 1/50th of the price of a tourist boat.

## TechDad's Tips (Technical Local Knowledge)

- **Air Conditioning:** In summer, look for the "Strong Cold" or "Weak Cold" car indicators on the platform. Strong cold is usually in the middle cars.
- **Manual Lanes:** If your QR code fails or you have a bulky stroller, go to the **Manned Service Desk** (the manual lane). The staff will manually scan you through.
- **Taxis vs Metro:** During peak hours, a Metro trip that takes 20 mins might take a taxi 60 mins. Always check **Amap** for real-time traffic "Red" (blocked) zones.

### Local Hacks & Money-Saving Tips
- **Metro Day-Passes:** Only worth it if you plan to make more than 6-7 trips in 24 hours. For most tourists, the standard QR code pay-as-you-go is more flexible.
- **Transfer Discount:** In Shanghai, transferring from a Bus to a Metro (or vice-versa) within 90 minutes gives you a **1 RMB discount**.
