# 12306 Name Verification Failure

**Last Updated:** Jan 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

### Problem
Foreign tourists cannot bind passports to 12306 (train booking) accounts.

### Root Cause
12306 backend ignores separate First/Last names; only checks full string.

### Fix / Solution
- Use MRZ code (bottom two lines of passport) in uppercase.  
- Include all spaces exactly.  
- Pre-verify online 24 hours before travel.

### Miles’ Tips
- With kids, avoid self-service gates; use manual / green channels.  

### Recommendations
- Check ticket at least 24h in advance.  
- Download 12306 app on phone.

### Local Hacks / Money-saving Tips
- Buy soft sleeper tickets early for comfort.  
- Use multi-leg tickets to save minor fare differences.
