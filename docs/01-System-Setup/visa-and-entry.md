# Visa & Entry Requirements (2026 Update)

**Last Updated:** Jan 23, 2026 | **Author:** TechDadShanghai

### Context
Navigating the rapidly changing visa policies and the digital entry process can be confusing for first-time visitors.

### The 2026 Reality
China has significantly expanded its visa-free policies. As of January 2026, many countries (including many in Europe, Asia, and Latin America) enjoy **30-day visa-free entry**. These policies are often pilot programs, so always verify with your local consulate.

## Visa Types & Eligibility

### 1. 30-Day Visa-Free (Pilot Program)
- **Eligibility:** Citizens of 46+ countries (check [en.nia.gov.cn](https://en.nia.gov.cn) for the latest list).
- **Duration:** Typically 30 days for tourism, business, or visiting family.
- **Rule:** No prior application is needed; just fly in with a valid passport.

### 2. 240-Hour (10-Day) Transit Visa-Free (TWOV)
- **Eligibility:** Available for US, Canadian, UK, and Australian citizens (among others) when transiting through major hubs like Shanghai, Beijing, or Guangzhou.
- **Requirement:** You **must** be flying to a third country (e.g., London -> Shanghai -> Tokyo). A simple round trip (London -> Shanghai -> London) does **not** qualify.
- **Duration:** 10 days (240 hours) within the specific region of entry.

### 3. Standard L-Visa (Tourism)
- For countries not covered by the above, you must apply at a Chinese Visa Application Service Center (CVASC) in your home country.

## The Digital Entry Process (Nov 2025+)

China has introduced a **New Digital Entry Card** system to speed up immigration.
1.  **Pre-fill Online:** Before arrival, visit the NIA website or search for the "Digital Entry Card" mini-program in Alipay/WeChat.
2.  **Generate QR Code:** Once filled, you will receive a QR code.
3.  **Scan at Border:** Use the QR code at the dedicated "Digital Card" kiosks or lanes at the airport for much faster processing.
4.  **Fallback:** Physical paper cards are still available at arrival halls if the digital system is down.

## Miles' Tips

- **Carry Proof of Accommodation** — Even with visa-free entry, officers often ask for your first hotel's address and phone number in Chinese. Have a screenshot ready.
- **Passport Validity** — Ensure your passport has at least **6 months** of validity and 2 blank pages.
- **Don't delete your VPN/Apps** — Some airport Wi-Fi is weak or restricted. Ensure your communication apps (WeChat/WhatsApp) are working before you land.

### Local Hacks & Safety Warnings
- **The "Tea Ceremony" Scam:** If a friendly "student" or "local" approaches you in a tourist area (like the Bund or People's Square) and invites you to a "traditional tea ceremony" or "art gallery," **politely decline**. This is a well-known trap that leads to a multi-thousand dollar bill.
- **Registration at Police:** If you are staying at a hotel, they handle your police registration automatically. If you stay at an Airbnb or with friends, you **must** register at the local police station within 24 hours (many cities now allow this via a WeChat mini-program).
